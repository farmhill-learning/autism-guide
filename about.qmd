# Introduction

Autism is a natural variation in how people’s brains work and experience the world. Autistic people may communicate, interact, and process information in ways that differ from the neurotypical majority. Because autism exists on a spectrum, each autistic person has their own unique strengths, challenges, and ways of engaging with their surroundings. Rather than viewing these differences as deficits, the neurodiversity perspective recognizes and values the diverse ways that brains can function and contribute to society.

*Throughout this document, we use identity-first language (such as “autistic person” or “autistic child”), in keeping with the preferences of many in the autistic community. However, we recognize and respect that some individuals may prefer person-first language.*

## The onset of Autism

Autism in children usually becomes noticeable around the age of 2 to 3 years, all though with increasing awareness, early identification is becoming more common these days.

Parents may first notice that their child engages with the world in unique ways. Some autistic children might communicate or play differently, such as not always responding to their name, making eye contact, or using spoken words in the same way as their peers. They may have distinct interests and find joy in activities that are meaningful to them, like watching fans spin, flapping their hands, rocking, singing, or arranging objects in specific patterns.

Some autistic children experience the world in ways that make transitions or unexpected changes particularly challenging. When routines are disrupted or sensory input becomes overwhelming, they may use strategies like focusing inward, seeking comfort in familiar activities, or engaging in repetitive movements—such as hand-flapping, rocking, or arranging objects—to self-regulate and manage their environment. These behaviors are meaningful ways for autistic children to cope with sensory overload or to express their needs, even if they look different from those of their peers.

Parents might notice these differences in how their child interacts, communicates, or responds to their surroundings. Seeking support from professionals such as developmental pediatricians or psychologists can help families better understand their child’s unique sensory and communication needs and access resources that foster acceptance, comfort, and growth.

## Why is this happening? How to deal with this?

While the exact reasons why some people are autistic are not fully understood, research suggests that a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors can influence neurodevelopmental diversity. Autism is a natural variation in how brains develop and function, and autistic people have unique ways of experiencing and interacting with the world. There is no need or way to “cure” autism, as it is not an illness or defect, but rather a different way of being. With understanding, acceptance, and appropriate supports, autistic individuals can thrive and lead fulfilling lives on their own terms, celebrating their strengths and contributions to the community.

## What does it mean for the parents, the child and family?

The immediate implication of autism diagnosis for the parents is that they need to rethink their ideas of parenting and their expectations of the child. Children on the spectrum may have various neurological and physiological differences that cause them to experience the world very differently from other people. Parents need to be willing to learn about their child and how their autism works. They need to be open to learning about various therapies and educational approaches in order to learn to support themselves and the child.

In the Indian context, where support from public institutions may be limited, a diagnosis of autism for the child may require the parents to radically rethink their lifestyle and goals. They may need to plan their lives such that one of the parents is available to support the child and coordinates with the doctors, therapists, school and other people who interact with the child.

While families may face challenges as they learn to support their autistic child, many also discover new perspectives, joys, and strengths within their family as they embrace neurodiversity and celebrate their child’s unique qualities.

## What is the way forward?

Once there is a diagnosis, the next thing to do is to think of various ways to start supporting the child. This usually takes the form of therapies - behavior therapies to start learning to understand and respond to the general behavior of the child; speech and language therapy to help open a channel of communication; occupational therapy or physical activities to help the child with physical regulation. The specific things that are done in each of the therapies depend on the specific strengths and needs of the child.

Whichever of these therapies are chosen, one needs to ensure the therapies are aimed at making life easier for the child and the family. The goal of these supports is not to change who the child is, but to help them access opportunities, build on their strengths, and participate fully in their community.Over a period of time, the therapies are supposed to build the skills and competencies of the child, show the family how to support the child, and over all, add to the quality of life of the family.

It also helps if parents continue to be involved in the therapies, understand the processes and learn the basic approaches, so that the child gets the same support whenever s/he needs it. It is important that any therapies or supports chosen are respectful of the child’s autonomy and preferences, and are never aimed at suppressing harmless autistic traits, but rather at empowering the child to thrive in their own way.

## How does schooling and education work?

Schooling and educational needs may vary according to the child’s capabilities, needs and interests. Thus, it is important to first develop an Individualised Education Plan (IEP) for the child based on his/her strengths and needs. The IEP generally takes into account the strengths and needs of the child, as seen by different people supporting the child - parents, therapists, teachers etc. - and outlines a plan to equip the child with required competencies.

Depending on the specific needs of the child, a child may go on to a mainstream school with accommodations or go to a special school. Some children may need additional help. Homeschooling may also be an option in some cases.

## Changing support needs of autistic people and families

Autism is a spectrum, which means it is expressed differently in each individual. Every autistic person has their own unique strengths, challenges, and ways of experiencing the world. As the saying goes, “If you’ve met one autistic person, you’ve met one autistic person.”

Some autistic people may have differences in coordination, communication, or motor planning, while others may also experience co-occurring conditions such as epilepsy, anxiety, intellectual disability, or depression. Each person’s needs and experiences are unique, and support strategies should be tailored to the individual.

Families may sometimes find it challenging to navigate the various supports, therapies, and educational approaches available, especially in contexts where resources are limited. This can also impact the family’s ability to socialize and connect with their community, and they may encounter barriers or misunderstandings from others.

As autistic children grow into teenagers and young adults, it is important for families and communities to continue learning, adapting, and supporting their evolving needs and identities. In India, there is a need for more inclusive opportunities and support systems for autistic individuals beyond childhood, including meaningful educational, vocational, and social options for teens and adults.

As autistic individuals grow, supporting their self-advocacy and listening to their voices becomes increasingly important. Empowering autistic people to express their needs and preferences helps ensure that support is truly person-centered.

## Life as an adult autistic

Autistic children grow up to become autistic adults, each with their own unique strengths, interests, and support needs. While many autistic adults develop skills and strategies for navigating the world, autism remains an integral part of who they are throughout their lives.

Because autism is a spectrum, the experiences and needs of autistic adults are diverse. Some may require ongoing support with daily living, health, or safety, while others may thrive independently or with minimal assistance. Many autistic adults benefit from supportive environments, understanding communities, and accommodations that help them manage sensory, social, or emotional differences. It’s important to recognize that needing support is not a reflection of someone’s value or potential, but simply a part of human diversity.

In India, opportunities and resources for autistic adults are still growing. There is an increasing need for inclusive education, employment, and community participation options that respect and celebrate neurodiversity. By fostering acceptance and providing meaningful support, we can help ensure that autistic adults are empowered to lead fulfilling lives and contribute to society in ways that honor their individuality.

## Understanding Autism - A video from Sethu {#understanding-autism---a-video-from-sethu}

Here is a video on "Understanding Autism" from [Sethu](https://sethu.in), a child development and family guidance center based in Goa. This video talks about the importance of getting a diagnosis, the causes of autism, and the challenges faced autistic people.

A brief summary of the video in bullet points:

-   Autism exists everywhere
-   Getting a diagnosis means that you now have the chance to access the right kind of intervention program for your child
-   There is no known cause of autism, but we know that it's nothing that you or anyone did that has caused your child to be autistic
-   It is a spectrum disorder, and your child is unique in terms of their strengths, interests and challenges
-   Your child experiences the world around in a very different way
-   Autistic children need support with their social communication and social interaction skills
-   They have a difficulty in processing all the information that their senses are taking in
-   Autism is not the same as an intellectual disability
-   Autism is not a disease, and it does not need a cure

*Note*: The video talks about understanding autism as "piecing together the puzzle". It may be useful to note that the puzzle analogy for autism is not approved by all the people living on the spectrum.
