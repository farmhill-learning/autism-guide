                    <h1>Inclusion - What it is and What it is not</h1>
                

                <p>“Inclusion is not a destination, but an approach.”</p>
<p>Inclusion is not about making autistic children less autistic. It does not operate from the belief that children will grow out of autism by being in an inclusive setup. It is also not just about the space - just because they are physically present in the space, does not mean a child is included.  If they are physically present, but are not attended to emotionally or no facilitation of meaningful learning takes place, inclusion has failed in that space.</p>
<p>Inclusion is often misunderstood as including children with special needs in a regular classroom. It goes deep beyond that, creating an environment where all the children irrespective of their neurological profile, physical ability, pace of learning, socioeconomic background, and any other differences, have equal access to the learning process and the curriculum being provided in the environment. It requires a fundamental shift in the system to remove barriers and meet the diverse needs of the children. Inclusive systems value the unique contributions students of all backgrounds bring to the classroom and allow diverse groups to grow side by side, to the benefit of all.</p>
<p>An inclusive system is built on the belief that a diverse classroom enriches the learning experience. The classroom culture promotes belonging - where everyone feels accepted, understood and valued. It could also include adults from diverse backgrounds or neurological profiles. In practical terms, it means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teachers are trained to work with children with various academic and other abilities</li>
<li>The system recognises different learning styles and paces as well as different ways of participating</li>
<li>The curriculum is flexible to adapt to different learners</li>
<li>There is time, space and energy built into the syste, to provide the required support - visuals, support teachers, sensory spaces, small group learning settings, extra academic support, emotional support etc. etc to help children access learning in a way that would work for them</li>
<li>The classroom culture promotes belonging - every child is participating, valued and accepted.</li>
<li>The environment reflects diversity among the adults who shape the learning environment, including teachers, aides, administrators, and support staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Inclusivity is actually maintained when all members of a group are able to participate in its activities, which means, provisions made are considerate of all members and not just those from specific groups or, with special abilities, disabilities, and/or needs.”</p>
<p>It's about making school a place where they can grow, learn, be themselves and feel respected. When classrooms/ systems are designed with multiple needs in mind, they become more flexible, compassionate, and effective learning environments for every student.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-inclusion-important">Why is inclusion important?</h3>
<p>Inclusion in education promotes equity, belonging and social change. It ensures all the children regardless of their abilities or learning styles, have meaningful learning experiences. For children who might have otherwise been excluded, inclusive systems provide a safe space for authentic expression allowing the child to thrive in his/her own terms.</p>
<p>Beyond the individual, inclusion enriches the entire ecosystem. It challenges stereotypes, reduces stigma and fosters empathy and collaboration among children and educators. In doing so, it paves the way to create a more just and equitable society, where differences are valued and not just accommodated.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-autism-in-the-school">Supporting autism in the school</h2>
<p>Now that schools are being called upon to meaningfully include diverse children, the role of schools and teachers requires intention, preparation and commitment. How should the school approach and support the admission of an autistic kid into the environment?</p>
<p>Before admission, schools should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assessment of readiness from both sides - just as a child’s readiness is essential, so is the school's. Does the school have the capacity - resources, training, and flexibility to provide a meaningful learning experience for the child?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a trained professional on board - Is there a professional on staff who will work with teachers to individualize instruction, adapt materials, and support the child’s specific needs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facility to involve shadow teachers or give one to one support - some children benefit greatly from a dedicated support person to navigate through the school routine. This person would ideally serve as a bridge between the child, teacher, and peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear criteria for admission - the criteria for admitting an autistic child should be clear and the school should ensure that adequate support is in place. If the school cannot support the child, the school should be honest with its limitations and if possible try building on the capacity to include the child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accommodations and flexibility - From sensory-friendly spaces and visual schedules to adapted assignments and adjusted expectations, schools must be ready to make accommodations not as exceptions, but as part of inclusive practice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once admitted, the school holds certain minimum responsibilities towards the learning journey of the child to make it meaningful and supportive:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Curating an IEP - An IEP is a roadmap tailored to the child’s goals, strengths, challenges, and supports required. It should be created in collaboration with the family and revised regularly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular meeting with parents - Parents and caregivers are experts in their child’s needs. Their involvement in setting goals and reviewing progress is essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensitisation and training for staff - All teachers and staff should receive basic training in neurodiversity, sensory regulation, emotional support strategies, and inclusive classroom practices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support-for-the-teachers">Support for the teachers</h3>
<p>As a teacher, one can expect the following support to facilitate meaningful experience for an autistic child:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Training in Inclusive Practices: understanding autism, communication styles, sensory processing, and behavior from a needs-based lens is foundational.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team Support: access to a special educator, therapist, or mentor with whom they can consult, plan, and troubleshoot. A collaborative team makes inclusion sustainable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classroom adaptation: Inclusion often requires shifting the way a classroom works - incorporating visual supports, allowing movement breaks, using predictable routines, offering multiple ways to demonstrate learning, and being flexible with acceptable behaviors should be allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasonable Workload: teachers cannot be expected to carry all the emotional and logistical responsibility alone. Schools should ensure that classrooms are not overcrowded, that support staff are available, and that expectations are realistic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="video-7-essential-things-teachers-should-know">Video - 7 Essential Things Teachers Should Know</h3>
<p>Here is a video in which Tayzeem Rasool, an autistic adult,  shares the 7 things he would like teachers to know about autism.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each autistic is different. Their strengths and challenges also differ.</li>
<li>Routines and schedules are very helpful.</li>
<li>The sensorial experiences of children with autism might be a lot more or less.</li>
<li>Stimming can help autistic children, do not force them to stop.</li>
<li>Give clear and step-by-step instructions.</li>
<li>Provide time for the child to process the language.</li>
<li>Use visuals while communicating or interacting as much as you can.</li>
</ul>

<p>By investing in training, collaboration, and meaningful accommodations, schools can become spaces where autistic children are not just present, but are understood, supported, and empowered to learn in their own way.</p>
<h2 id="video-education-for-all-schooling-issues-in-autism">Video - Education for All - schooling issues in autism</h2>
<p>In the video below, Giselle Lobo, a special educator and head of inclusive education services at <a href="https://sethu.in">Sethu</a>, Goa, addresses parents to help them understand what goes into making choices for finding the right school and to provide them with a few guidelines when it comes to selecting a school for their children. Here is a summry:</p>
<ul>
<li>making a decision where to place your child in which school to place your child is extremely difficult especially for parents of kids with autism</li>
<li>in order to make the right choice as to which school you are going to admit your child into you have to have a very good understanding of your child - the level of skills that your child has in self-help, being able to follow instructions and play</li>
<li>you also need to understand the background of the school does the school welcome children is it willing to be accommodative, modify curriculum and the environment to support your child</li>
<li>you also need to be aware of the curriculum that your child will benefit from most a functional curriculum or an academic curriculum </li>
<li>do you have the option to place your child in a mainstream school with a life skills resource room or an academic resource room </li>
<li>and finally, be aware of the supports your child needs - a visual schedule, a shadow teacher, buddies, activity based instruction, and see if the school is willing to provide them</li>
</ul>
