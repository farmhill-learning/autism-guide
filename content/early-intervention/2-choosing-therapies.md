# Choosing therapies

As discussed abovce, early intervention approaches need to address language and communication, social, physical, sensory, behavioral, and emotional goals. One therapy or approach is unlikely to address all these goals. Usually, a combination of behavior therapy like ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis), Speech and Language Therapy and Occupational Therapy are recommended. In addition, there are many other options like art therapy, music therapy, play therapy, animal therapy and so on. In the Indian context, there are alternatives like homeopathy, ayurveda and other traditional medicines. In addition, there are approaches like supplementary diets, medicines etc.

In this era of internet, news media and social media, each of these proven or unproven treatments are promoted through stories of success. Also, since every person's autism is unique, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to address the needs of every person on the spectrum. There is an overwhelming amount of information available, and making an informed decision becomes a challenge.

## A few guidelines

You should learn to critically evaluate the information you receive. Get information from objective sources.

+ People promoting various treatments may really want to help your child but may also have additional business motives.

+ Anyone making claims about “complete recovery” from autism or “curing” autism should be viewed with suspicion. There are no cures for autism.

+ The therapy approaches you choose should be evidence based. This means there should be enough scientific evidence that the approach works. Please remember that anecdotes are not evidence. Evidence-based practices include behavior approaches, developmental approaches like speech language therapy and occupational therapy.

+ The therapy approach or the combination of approaches you choose should be able to address all the goals mentioned above for the child. The therapy approach should enable you to get an assessment of your child’s specific needs in each of these areas and provide a comprehensive plan to progress on each of them.

+ The demands of the therapy approach should be aligned with your family’s capacity. For example, if a therapy approach needs you to spend more time with the child, you need to think of whether you can do this or not. It should also suit your financial ability.

+ Complimentary approaches involving working with art, music, movement, animals, swimming, play should be treated as complimentary therapies. These can be practiced in addition to the evidence-based early intervention approaches above.

+ Most methods of working with autism work slowly compared to the quick results one expects from medical treatments. That is the way it is. Anyone making time bound promises like “making your child school ready in six months” needs to be evaluated with caution.

+ Since there are no medicines for the core symptoms of autism, one needs to be cautious about medication as a solution. Please evaluate the medication carefully. With young children, it may be best to avoid medication except in case of severe medical conditions like seizures.

+ Extra caution is advised in using medication from ayurveda and other traditional medical systems. Most of these medications may be untested and unproven. Homeopathy may also be approached with caution – there are many controversies about whether it works at all. One of the problems with relying on unproven alternatives and medications is that these practices distract the family, divert attention from what needs to be done and may even interfere with the therapies.

+ Similarly, the efficacy of diets and supplements is at best questionable. An additional problem with restrictive diets is that children end up being deprived of many commonly consumed food items and may be nutritionally impacted. This feeling of deprivation may result in behaviors like grabbing food from others. Additionally, in the Indian culture where most social occasions revolve around food, children may also be socially impacted. While putting a child on a diet may look like an easy option, it may end up having profound consequences.

**In summary, the key to choosing a good approach is to go with one that is evidence based, addresses the development needs of the child, and suits the family circumstances.**
