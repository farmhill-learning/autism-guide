## Video - Celebrating Neurodiversity: Autistic Singers, Dancers & Down Syndrome Model 

Here is a video showcasing experiences of four autistic adults made by Ummeed Child Development Center. They share their experiences and perspectives on art being a tool for self expression and empowerment.
These are a few points covered in the video:

- Priyankar Ganguly, Swara Swami, Zainika Jagasia and Usaid Shaikh are artists who express themselves through music, dance, designing and modelling.
- They share their strengths and challenges they face in a society that often misunderstands or overlooks them.
- They emphasize on the importance of autonomy, dignity and self-advocacy.
- Family and community support play a crucial role in their journeys.
- The four of them ask everyone to stop undermining autistics and to change their perceptions about disability and for greater inclusion.
