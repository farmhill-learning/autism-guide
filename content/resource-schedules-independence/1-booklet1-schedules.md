## Schedules: A Path to Independence

### Understanding Schedules{.unnumbered}

A **schedule** is a structured list of events or activities, laid out in a way that fits the person using it. Schedules can be visual, written, or digital, and are especially supportive for autistic and neurodivergent individuals. A schedule is not something imposed—it's a shared tool that respects agency, adapts to preferences, and grows with the individual.

### Why Use a Schedule?{.unnumbered}

Schedules are more than just plans; they're companions for the day. They:

- **Organize** your day, giving a sense of what’s coming next.
- **Create calm** by reducing surprises.
- **Reduce overwhelm and anxiety**, especially when the world feels unpredictable.

A truly helpful schedule is *personal* and *meaningful.* It isn’t just followed—it belongs to the person who uses it. Any change should be discussed together.

## How Schedules Foster Agency

### Getting Started{.unnumbered}

- At first, a caregiver may plan the schedule.
- The goal is collaboration: plan *with* the person using the schedule, not only *for* them.
- Refer to examples like the 'Managing children at home' guide for varied age groups.

### Helping with Choices{.unnumbered}

- Agency starts with choosing.
- Offer visuals of activities (e.g., two pictures), let the person pick what to add.
- If someone is distressed, offer a choice: "Do you want this activity?" If the answer is "No," gently ask or present another option.
- Use *yes/no* questions and let the person’s voice lead the process.
- Some children tend to choose the same activity repeatedly. This is okay initially, as it builds comfort with the choice-making process. Gradually introduce new options alongside familiar ones to expand their preferences over time. The related schedule can look like this.

### Growing Independence as a Skill{.unnumbered}

Independence is learned over time. It's not an abstract value—it's a skill you develop, with support.

**Within an Activity - To become independent in an activity:**

- Know the steps.

- Have the skills to do each step.

- Use visual cues or transitions to move between steps.

**Within a Schedule - For independent use of a schedule:** 

- Understand how to transition between activities.

- Identify the next activity and gather the right items.

- Signal for help when needed.

**Over a Day - To manage an entire day:**

- Recognize the day's activities.

- Adjust for what’s planned each day (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends).

- Manage time as well as tasks.

**Owning the Whole Process - For full independence:** 

- Set personal goals.

- Break down big tasks into manageable steps over several days.

- Track progress, add breaks and self-care, and balance both short-term needs and long-term hopes.

## What a Schedule Does (And Doesn’t Do)

- A schedule says *what* to do, not *how* to do it.
- Skills for each activity need to be taught and practiced separately.

### Practical Uses of Schedules{.unnumbered}

Schedules can support:

- Daily routines from wake-up to bedtime (full-day schedules).
- Specific periods (partial schedules).
- Repeating favorite activities.
- Waiting for turn or favorite activities.
- Easing into activities that are harder to start.
- Handling anxiety about new or non-preferred tasks.
- Completing every step in multi-step routines (like morning or night routines).

### Functional Benefits{.unnumbered}

- **Gives visibility:** See what comes next in the day.
- **Supports transitions:** Clear beginnings and endings make change easier.
- **Helps with priming:** Knowing when a less-favorite activity is coming makes it more manageable.
- **Reduces repetitive questioning:** Reliance shifts from checking with a caregiver to checking the schedule, fostering independence.
- **Builds executive functioning:** Practicing planning, organizing, and carrying out tasks.
