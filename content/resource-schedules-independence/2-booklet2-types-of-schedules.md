## Types of Schedules - by duration

- **Full-Day Schedule:** Outlines events from wake-up to sleep, including free time.
- **Partial Schedule:** Focuses on segments (e.g., morning, school time, play time).
- **Activity Schedule:** Breaks down steps in routines (e.g., morning routine: wake up, fold bed, brush teeth, use the washroom).

During *free time*, support the person in choosing their favorite activities. Guide the process at first. Gradually, allow for independent planning—step by step.

Here are examples of these types of schedules.

## Types of Schedules - Visual and Written

- **Visual schedules**: Attach 3-4 activities at a time, add more as needed. Some might need to see the whole day at once.
- **Written schedules**: Use simple language, check off as you go.

Schedules can be chunked for part of a day or a single activity (e.g., steps for brushing or an exercise routine). Some may use digital versions (like Google Keep).

## Making Changes to Schedules

Change is part of life. Schedules can flex, but these steps help:

1. **Inform** the person about the change (don't surprise them, unless it's urgent).
2. **Make the change together**—update the schedule in front of them.
3. **Pause** when upset; use emotion charts or yes/no questions to discuss feelings and new choices.
4. **Offer alternatives:** Let the person pick what comes next.
5. **Example:**  
   - If painting can’t happen (no paints at home), acknowledge the disappointment, apologize, and suggest options (like going for a walk). Change the schedule together.
