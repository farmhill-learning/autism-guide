| Challenge                                 | Response                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Schedules are rigid"                      | Schedules add variety and predictability, which eases transitions.       |
| "Needs a caregiver always"                 | Early on, yes—but schedules build independence over time.                |
| "What to add (or not add)?"                | Include both fun and challenging activities. Make the schedule balanced. |
| "Too many activities/too long"             | Define clear beginnings and endings using visual cues or timers.         |
| "Need to get things ready"                 | Being organized helps the process—model and encourage prep habits.       |
| "Requires adults’ time"                    | Caregivers can take turns; agency grows and everyone gets more space.    |
| "Child gets bored"                         | Mix things up; see schedules as sequences, not static routines.          |
| "Emotionally overwhelming"                 | Go at a pace that feels right; self-care for parents is important too.   |
| "How long are schedules needed?"           | Schedules help throughout life, for everyone; focus shifts to self-agency over time. |
| "People become dependent on schedules"     | Schedules support independent living—*not* dependency.                   |
| "Both parents are busy"                    | Take turns, support each other, and transition towards independence.     |

## Common reasons people say "schedules don't work"

Scheduling can feel really difficult for the caregivers in the beginning. Scheduling and sticking to the schedule are difficult even with adults. 

A schedule demands accountability, responsibility and consistency from the parent/facilitator. If the person holding it together is not organised, schedules are likely to cause more distress and disharmony. This is likely to foster sense of failure and lead to procrastination at pathological levels. 

* The most common reasons for scheuduling "not working" are:

- Putting an activity in the schedule and not doing it. One needs to ensure to plan such that the child learns to think about schedule as essential to be followed.
- Making changes to the schedule however we want. Any changes can be made only after informing the child. Even then, it is ideal to reason why it is being done. 
- Doing some activities and leaving some activities. 
- Doing on some days and not doing on some days.
- Bringing in schedule only when there are challenging behaviors. Then the autistic person feels its a punishment for their bad behavior resulting in resentment towards schedule.

## Without a Schedule

The alternative is rarely easier. Not having a schedule can mean:

- More corrections and redirections.
- Less predictability.
- Difficulty starting or completing activities.
- Disordered routines, like snacking or screen time at odd hours.
- More emotional dysregulation (for everyone).

A schedule offers direction, agency, and calm.

## Final Thoughts

Schedules are not just tools—they’re bridges to agency, independence, and calmer days. They can be as flexible and creative as needed, always centered around the neurodivergent person’s right to choice, respect, and joyful participation in life.


*When agency is shared and supported, daily living skills become more manageable, motivation increases, and the bond between caregiver and child grows stronger.*



*Please note that these interventions are shared for general guidance. Designing and executing interventions - more importantly - noticing how the child responds and modifying the interventions so the child does not get distressed, is a specialist job. Consult qualified therapists as necessary.*
