# Family and Friends Lesson Plans

As children grow up they usually gravitate towards other children of similar age and these bonds become stronger around teenage. This is a well researched aspect of human development and it satisfies many of the secondary needs for a person like the need to belong, how well regarded a person is, builds their self esteem and confidence and aids further potential.

When children are on the autism spectrum, we see that the younger children engage in parallel play. Their atypical communication is interpreted as indifference and not having connections. They may not have access to vocabulary and some of the ideas,aspects and layers of relationships. That could lead to certain socially inappropriate behaviors which alienate them further and cause distress to the autistic person as well as the people around. Learning to raise boundaries is important to have good relationships as well as self preservation. Therefore, this lesson becomes an essential element in emotional education.
