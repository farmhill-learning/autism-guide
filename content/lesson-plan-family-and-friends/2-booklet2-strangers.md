## Activities

### Activity 1
Introduce the idea of known people and strangers and sort people

#### How to conduct the activity

- Explain: "People I know are known people. People I don't know are strangers." 
- Use role play: Facilitator acts as teacher ("You know me"), then stranger ("Am I a stranger?").
- Show mixed picture cards one at a time. Students sort into "Known People" and "Strangers" trays. Ask: "Why here? Because you know them or not?" Respond verbally, via Avaz, or point to visuals.

### Activity 2
Extend to three categories 

#### How to conduct the activity

- Extend to three categories : Add "Family" pictures from Booklet 1. Create a three-ring circle chart: Family – Known People – Strangers.

- Sort them into 3 categories. 
- Reinforce the idea that Family - we live in the same space, Known people-  people we see regularly, whom we know. Strangers - people we do not know. 
- Fill the three ring circle chart after the discussion. Use the example chart provided and help the children make one for themselves reflecting them,their family,known people and strangers.

### Activity 3 
Actions with Each Group

This activity is to distinguish and establish what we do with each group of people. 

#### How to conduct the activity

- Provide word strips of actions (e.g., smile/greet/ask for help with known people; buy things/take deliveries with strangers; hug/play with family).
- Students sort actions under each category on charts or scrapbooks. Discuss: "We follow boundaries with everyone for safety."
- Game 1: Role play scenarios: Neighbor (known), delivery person (stranger), classmate (known). This is played like passing the parcel. Make chits indicating various roles like neighbour, teacher, mother, friend. Each child picks a chit in their turn. They open and read it and act according to the role written in the chit. 
- Game 2:  Find which one is it?   Keep the visual ready with the three words. ‘Family, known people and strangers’. This is also played like passing the parcel. Make chits indicating various actions with do with different people. The children take turns, open the chit, read it and indicate whether we can do it with family, known people or stranger.
