## Observable signs of autism

When you notice any of the following signs in the children around you, it is useful to consult a developmental psychologist or a developmental pediatrician at the earliest. It is possible that these signs do not mean autism, but if they do, then you would have recognized these differences a little earlier and started providing support, thereby helping the child access resources and understanding sooner.

### Differences in reaching developmental milestones

 Autistic children may show some early signs of being on the spectrum, such as reaching developmental milestones on their own timeline or engaging differently with their environment (these vary for each child).

+ Does not respond to name by 9 months of age
+ Does not show facial expressions like happy, sad, angry, and surprised by 9 months of age
+ Does not play simple interactive games like pat-a-cake by 12 months of age
+ Uses few or no gestures by 12 months of age (for example, does not wave goodbye)
+ Does not share interests with others by 15 months of age (for example, shows you an object that they   like)
+ Does not point to show you something interesting by 18 months of age
+ Does not notice when others are hurt or upset by 24 months of age
+ Does not notice other children and join them in play by 36 months of age
+ Does not pretend to be something else, like a teacher or superhero, during play by 48 months of age
+ Does not sing, dance, or act for you by 60 months of age

### Communication differences

About 40% of autistic children do not use spoken language, and between 25% and 30% develop some language skills during infancy but then communicate differently as they grow. Some autistic children start using spoken language later in life, or may use alternative forms of communication.

Many autistic children communicate in ways that differ from neurotypical expectations, including:

+ Does not give or sustain eye contact
+ Delayed speech and language skills
+ Flat, robotic speaking voice, or singsong voice
+ Echolalia (repeating the same phrase over and over)
+ Reversal of pronouns (saying “you” instead of “I,” for example)
+ Not using or rarely using common gestures (pointing or waving), and not responding to them
+ Does not stay on topic when talking or answering questions
+ Not recognizing sarcasm or joking
+ Trouble expressing needs and emotions
+ Not getting signals from body language, tone of voice, and expressions

### Repetitive behaviors and focused interests

Autistic people may have unique ways of engaging with the world, such as focusing deeply on particular interests or using repetitive movements to self-regulate. 

Examples of repetitive behaviors and focused interests that are common among autistic people can include:

+ Lines up toys or other objects and gets upset when order is changed
+ Plays with toys the same way every time
+ Is focused on parts of objects (for example, wheels)
+ Has strong preference for routines
+ Has focused interests
+ Flaps hands, rocks body, or spins self in circles
+ Has unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel
+ Has strong likes and dislikes with respect to food 
+ Differences in coordination and movement 
+ Acting quickly or impulsively 
+ Expressing distress through strong emotions or actions
+ Varied attention spans

### Other Characteristics

Many autistic people may also experience other characteristics, such as:

+ Differences in cognitive or learning skills
+ Hyperactive, impulsive, and/or inattentive behavior
+ Co-occuring conditions like Epilepsy or seizure disorder
+ Unique eating and sleeping habits
+ Gastrointestinal issues (for example, constipation)
+ Distinct emotional reactions
+ Experiences of anxiety, stress, or excessive worry
+ Differences in experiencing and expressing fear

Autistic people often have unique strengths, such as deep focus, creativity, attention to detail, and passionate interests. Recognizing and valuing these qualities helps build a more inclusive and supportive community.
