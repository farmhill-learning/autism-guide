# Identifying Autism

Autism is a neurodevelopmental variation. The most effective way to support autistic people is through understanding, acceptance, and providing individualized supports and accommodations. Early identification can help families and communities better understand and support autistic individuals.

However, autism is a spectrum condition, so the symptoms may vary in type and severity from child to child. In addition, since each child develops in his/her own way, some early signs of autism look like they are part of the natural development of the child. Also, Indian families often tend to think that speaking a little late, being a little unresponsive, is nothing to worry about. One often hears things like "oh, his father spoke at three, look he is all fine now!" and "boys start speaking late anyway".

All of this makes early identification and action difficult for parents. Other family members and friends tend to keep their peace till the child is older. Most medical professionals may also advise a wait and watch approach.

While autism can look different in different children, the most common areas of difference are communication and interaction with others. Signs of autism can be noticed when the children are around 2-3 years of age or even earlier. Parents and caregivers may watch for these signs.

*Throughout this document, we use identity-first language (such as “autistic person” or “autistic child”), in keeping with the preferences of many in the autistic community. However, we recognize and respect that some individuals may prefer person-first language. We also strive to be neurodiversity affirming in our approach.*
