# Current understanding – 2024

Today, "autism" refers to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by challenges in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. The contemporary understanding emphasizes the multifactorial nature of autism, involving a complex interplay of genetic, neurological, and environmental factors.

“Working in different political, cultural and research settings might have influenced the way each of them perceived autism. Ultimately, it took a spectrum of these researchers to define autism’s full spectrum.”
