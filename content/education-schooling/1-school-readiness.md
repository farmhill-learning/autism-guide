# School Readiness

Readiness for school is often equated to chronological age or cognitive abilities. But for an autistic child, it is not just about the ABCs and 123s. School readiness involves a broader functional set of skills which help them navigate and benefit out of a group environment - being able to engage, communicate and learn in a shared space. School readiness in the child can look like:

* Being able to communicate their needs - communication doesn’t equate speech (Read more on [speech vs. communication](https://autism.farmhill.in/early-intervention.html#autism-speech-and-communication)). Whether verbal or non-verbal, the child should have a reliable method of communication. It can be through speech or gestures or visuals or using assistive technology. It is important because it facilitates participation in class, seeking help and expressing discomfort, if any.

* Being able to handle separation from the primary caregiver - the child should be able to stay away from the caregiver for a period of time without significant distress. This can be built gradually with support.

* Ability to self-regulate or co-regulate - A packed school day full of transitions can get overwhelming for autistic children. They should be able to use calming strategies or be open to receiving help from adults to navigate challenges like waiting, turn taking or emotional ups and downs

* Ability to participate in a group - The child should be ready or be gradually supported to be a part of a shared space, among peers and adults. Apart from social interaction, group readiness also means ability to follow group rules and routines, managing the noise and navigating the social dynamics. 

* Ability to access the learning - learning could be through visuals or by observing or even a small group (1:3) support, but the child should be able to access the learning i.e be receptive to the learning. Learning can be social skills or academics or functional skills. 

## Prerequisite skills - preschool and primary school

Preschools are often the first structured social environment a child is exposed to. For an autistic kid, this requires careful planning. The focus here again should not be solely on age, but the readiness. Key prerequisite skills include:

* Basic communication - the child should have a functional way to express their needs

* Separation tolerance - the child should be able to be away from the primary caregiver for a brief duration without extreme distress

* Tolerance for group settings - the ability to stay in a space with others without distress or disruptive behaviors

* Regulation - being able to regulate emotions with support

* Awareness of and interest in peers- ability to show interest in others even if not interacting as much.

At the primary school level, the environment becomes more demanding. There is an expectation of sustained attention, task completion, and social cooperation.

* Understanding and following routines: the child should be able to follow structured daily routines with some predictability.

* Attention span: the ability to stay engaged in an activity for at least 10–15 minutes with adult support.

* Instruction comprehension: understanding simple one- or two-step instructions.

* Emotional regulation skills: cope with changes, handle sensory inputs, and seek help when distressed.

* Academic foundations: Foundational academic skills have to be in place for a meaningful learning experience - recognition of letters, numbers, colors or at least emerging pre-academic skills.
