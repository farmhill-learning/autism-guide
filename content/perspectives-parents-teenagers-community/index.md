# Perspectives of Parents of teenagers in a community learning space

This section explores the perspectives of four sets of parents whose teenage children are on the autism spectrum, all participating in a community learning space. We outline each child's profile, including their diagnosis age and communication methods, before discussing the parents' experiences with early signs and diagnosis. We further detail their initial emotional responses, the early intervention choices they made, and where they initially sourced information about autism. Finally, we cover their transition from early intervention, their current approaches to managing family life, their hopes and apprehensions for the future, and the advice they offer to newly diagnosed parents. This article is based on in-person interviews conducted in June/July 2024. 

All the four sets of parents and children are part of a community learning space, some full time and some part time, where they work together in groups, with other mothers and children on the spectrum. They have help from experts in behavior intervention and teaching learning processes.
