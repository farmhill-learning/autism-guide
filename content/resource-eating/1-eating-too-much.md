# Eating too much

This is by far the most common issue with neurodiverse children, especially as they grow up. Children eat because food calms them down, it provides actual psychological comfort! Most neurodiverse children also do not have well developed interoception that tells them when they are full. Sometimes, food not being available makes them upset and aggressive. 

While food calms them down, overeating affects health negatively. It is necessary to address this. 

Food and eating is a lifestyle issue. The entire family has to follow, model and reinforce the behaviour we expect of them. Working together and supporting each other is important. 

1. Make a weekly menu plan together. Include favourite as well as not favourite foods. The menu gives visibility of when favourite food is scheduled and helps prepare oneself for the not so favourite food. Remember to accommodate fancy food items and some junk food so there is no sense of deprivation. 
2. The menu should cover all meals - midmorning snack, evening tea etc. If it is not on the menu, you do not eat it. 
3. Agree on measurements - we will have one samosa each; or one bowl of popcorn. Do not prepare or buy more than that. 
4. On a daily basis, for every meal, everyone gets into the habit of measuring and eating - two rotis, one bowl of biryani etc. This shows them that everyone is following the same rules. 
5. Remember it is okay to say - “you have eaten your share. We can have this again - in the evening/tomorrow/next week” - as per your menu. 

Talk together, plan, do it together - modelling is very important. 

Take help of your therapists to handle any behaviours around food. Also, start when the children are young, it helps them get into good routines and helps everyone!
