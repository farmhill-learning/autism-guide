# What is the way forward?

Once there is a diagnosis, the next thing to do is to think of various ways to start supporting the child. This usually takes the form of therapies - behavior therapies to start learning to understand and respond to the general behavior of the child; speech and language therapy to help open a channel of communication; occupational therapy or physical activities to help the child with physical regulation. The specific things that are done in each of the therapies depend on the specific strengths and needs of the child.

Whichever of these therapies are chosen, one needs to ensure the therapies are aimed at making life easier for the child and the family. The goal of these supports is not to change who the child is, but to help them access opportunities, build on their strengths, and participate fully in their community.Over a period of time, the therapies are supposed to build the skills and competencies of the child, show the family how to support the child, and over all, add to the quality of life of the family.

It also helps if parents continue to be involved in the therapies, understand the processes and learn the basic approaches, so that the child gets the same support whenever s/he needs it. It is important that any therapies or supports chosen are respectful of the child’s autonomy and preferences, and are never aimed at suppressing harmless autistic traits, but rather at empowering the child to thrive in their own way.

## How does schooling and education work?

Schooling and educational needs may vary according to the child’s capabilities, needs and interests. Thus, it is important to first develop an Individualised Education Plan (IEP) for the child based on his/her strengths and needs. The IEP generally takes into account the strengths and needs of the child, as seen by different people supporting the child - parents, therapists, teachers etc. - and outlines a plan to equip the child with required competencies.

Depending on the specific needs of the child, a child may go on to a mainstream school with accommodations or go to a special school. Some children may need additional help. Homeschooling may also be an option in some cases.

## Changing support needs of autistic people and families

Autism is a spectrum, which means it is expressed differently in each individual. Every autistic person has their own unique strengths, challenges, and ways of experiencing the world. As the saying goes, “If you’ve met one autistic person, you’ve met one autistic person.”

Some autistic people may have differences in coordination, communication, or motor planning, while others may also experience co-occurring conditions such as epilepsy, anxiety, intellectual disability, or depression. Each person’s needs and experiences are unique, and support strategies should be tailored to the individual.

Families may sometimes find it challenging to navigate the various supports, therapies, and educational approaches available, especially in contexts where resources are limited. This can also impact the family’s ability to socialize and connect with their community, and they may encounter barriers or misunderstandings from others.

As autistic children grow into teenagers and young adults, it is important for families and communities to continue learning, adapting, and supporting their evolving needs and identities. In India, there is a need for more inclusive opportunities and support systems for autistic individuals beyond childhood, including meaningful educational, vocational, and social options for teens and adults.

As autistic individuals grow, supporting their self-advocacy and listening to their voices becomes increasingly important. Empowering autistic people to express their needs and preferences helps ensure that support is truly person-centered.
