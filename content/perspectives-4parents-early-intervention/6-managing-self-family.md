# Managing self and family

How are you managing yourself and your family through this?

**S-Am**

Managing our family has been difficult. When I spend time with the 2 children I feel like I have to deal with 2 different minds. My older son understands, but I feel like I am spending less time with him. Even while I am with Am, I keep thinking about what he would be doing. Husband is working full time.

**P-M**

All of it put together did take a toll on us as it was only me and my husband taking care of two children, mostly me. It’s a little easier now as the younger child is going to school. I am able to manage M’s schedule better while he goes to school.

**Y-An**

At this point, I am not thinking about myself at all. My personal life is not in the radar. After my first kid itself priorities started to change and now after An, he is the first priority. For now here in India, I have my mother’s support. So a huge chunk of my responsibilities otherwise, household chores, is taken care of. My daughter has also started to manage herself. When An was born, she was already 8 years old, so managing 2 children has not been a problem for me. My husband is managing himself back in Spain. The good thing here is that this decision was not forced upon anyone. It is mutual and a collective decision. We thought we should not regret not trying this option. So we all are up for trying this for 1 year and seeing where it takes us.

**J-S**

My family supports me immensely through this process. I cannot imagine doing any of this without their support. I am very grateful to my mother, brother and husband. They have extended their best support possible during testing times. Now my younger kid goes to school and I come with S for his therapies. S’s behaviors are also manageable so I am able to manage both my kids now.
