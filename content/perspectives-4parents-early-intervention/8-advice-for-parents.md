# Advice for other parents

What advice would you give to other parents who are just starting this journey?

**S-Am**

My advice would be for parents to start whatever has to be done, immediately and not think too much and waste time. Try and figure it out. Do whatever has to be done for now.

**P-M**

My advice would be to be understanding of the child and not compare any child with another child. Keep your focus on the child during their primary years.

**Y-An**

Believe in the almighty and his plans
Trust the process
When 1 door closes, see the 10 windows that are still open
Put the efforts you have to put in and trust it. Things will definitely change 1 day.
I also have advice for the parents of neurotypical children out there - Be supportive, if you can’t then at least do not be hurtful or harmful. Just let us parents be and don’t pass your judgements.

**J-S**

Spend as much time with children and keep observing
Take suggestions of others into account but do your research and choose.
Accept the reality and take care of yourself during the process
This is God's creation - give all the support, love and care for the child
To the families of neurotypical children - Support parents of neurodiverse kids and don't get into the blame game.
