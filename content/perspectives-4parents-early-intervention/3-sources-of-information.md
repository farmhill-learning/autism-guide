# Sources of information about autism

Where did your knowledge of autism and how to work with it come from initially? Was it helpful? When and where did you find the most useful knowledge so far?

**S-Am**

To be honest, I am still not sure if I know it all or if I have understood what is going on with Am. We hear different opinions from different people and it is more confusing. We don’t know what is right and what is wrong yet. Some ask us to stop everything, some ask us to take ABA, Speech and OT. I am still confused if I am doing right by Am. So I can’t say if I actually have the knowledge I need to have. The resources I have collected so far are only through other parents. I am not experienced with technology also. Anything I need, I ask my older child and he looks for it and gives.

**P-M**

My knowledge has majorly been from Google. Even the current ABA center, SCA, I found out myself through google. At a rehab center M went to initially, they gave us some understanding, but Google has been helpful for me.

**Y-An**

My knowledge came from doctors, specialists and fellow parents. The most useful knowledge I have found so far is from fellow parents. Hearing their experiences of how they approached or what they did has helped me in shifting perspectives and taking decisions.

**J-S**

It mostly came from professionals, where we went to seek diagnosis/ therapy. From the detailed report is where I gained the most clarity. And now the ABA sessions here are helping me to learn managing S. And this has been the most useful knowledge for me so far.
