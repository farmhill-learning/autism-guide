# Future - Hopes and apprehensions

What are your hopes and apprehensions as you think of the future for your child?

**S-Am**

My hope is that he becomes independent and is able to manage himself irrespective of whether my older son takes care of him. My fear is the question “Who after me for him?”

**P-M**

I hope that M is independent and can do without my help. My fear is also on the same lines. After me, what and who is a question that keeps lingering on my mind.

**Y-An**

About the future, I don’t want to think much as it is uncertain. I am in the mindset of doing whatever it takes in the present. We never know what will happen tomorrow. Let’s do whatever has to be done in the present, and the Almighty will take care of the rest. I put my energy into thinking about what I can do today.

**J-S**

Hopes - He should be independent as much as possible. Financially we should build and keep as much as possible for him to support himself. If he is able to manage, then it would be good. I try to improve the sibling bond in hope that their bond would be supportive.
Fear - They are slowly reducing as I see changes in S now.
