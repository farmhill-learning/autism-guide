## Communication in Teen Years

Communication often changes significantly during adolescence. Some autistic teens become more verbal, while others may increasingly rely on alternative methods such as writing, pictures, or communication devices. It's essential for adults to respect and support all forms of communication, recognizing that spoken words are just one valid method of expression.

Alternative communication methods—including sign language, typing, or communication apps—are equally legitimate and should be actively encouraged. The focus should be on effective expression rather than forcing conformity to verbal communication expectations.

#### Social Communication Challenges{.unnumbered}

As teens grow, social situations become exponentially more complex. Most autistic adolescents need explicit support in understanding how to discuss feelings, develop friendships, and request help when needed. The unwritten rules of teenage social interaction often remain mysterious without direct instruction and practice.

Many autistic teens begin "masking" their differences during adolescence—hiding their authentic selves to fit in with others. This can be exhausting and lead to significant stress, anxiety, and depression. Creating safe spaces where teens don't need to mask helps them feel more comfortable, accepted, and able to develop genuine relationships.

#### Developing Self-Advocacy Skills{.unnumbered}

Self-advocacy represents a critical skill for autistic teens. They should be encouraged to speak up about their needs, whether requesting sensory breaks, asking for support, or saying "no" to situations that cause discomfort. Including teens in meetings about their education, therapy, or healthcare helps them learn to make informed decisions about their lives.

This process begins with the agency-building discussed earlier—recognizing and validating teens' choices in daily matters creates the foundation for more complex self-advocacy skills.

#### Supporting Communication Development{.unnumbered}

* **Family Support** - Families can foster communication by making home a place where all feelings, expressions, and communication styles are welcomed and valued[attached_file:1]. This includes accepting non-verbal communication, supporting alternative communication methods, and avoiding pressure to "act normal."

* **School Support** - Educational settings should respect different communication styles and provide necessary tools like AAC devices. Teachers and staff need training in recognizing and responding to various communication forms, not just traditional speech.

* **Community Understanding** - Broader community education helps everyone learn to listen and respond to all forms of communication, creating more inclusive environments for autistic teens to practice and develop their skills.
