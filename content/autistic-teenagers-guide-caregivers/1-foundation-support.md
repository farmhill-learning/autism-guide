## Building a Positive Foundation - Pre-teens

The pre-teen years (9-12 years) represent a crucial window of opportunity for preparing autistic children for adolescence. During this period, children become increasingly aware of themselves and their differences from peers. Rather than waiting for difficulties to escalate during the teenage years, families and professionals can begin conversations that foster self-understanding, acceptance, and agency. Preparing children early — emotionally, socially, and academically — helps them enter adolescence with more resilience.

* **Creating Neurodiversity-Affirming Self-Image** Open, honest communication about neurodiversity helps children understand that their brains work differently - and that this is perfectly acceptable. Framing autism as a difference rather than a deficit is crucial. These early years are ideal for discussing strengths, interests, and support needs in ways that feel empowering and affirming.

* **Preparing for Change** Puberty brings physical, emotional, and social changes that can be especially confusing or distressing for autistic children if not discussed proactively. Early, gentle conversations about bodily changes, emotional shifts, and social expectations create a foundation for understanding and self-advocacy.

* **Social skills development** focus on understanding concepts like turn-taking, reading facial expressions, and recognizing when someone needs space through real-life examples, role-play, and observation. Rather than rigid social rules, the focus should be on understanding different types of relationships and appropriate boundaries in various contexts.

* **Fostering Agency** Children benefit from gradually being given more influence over daily decisions - what to wear, what to eat, how to spend free time. This builds agency and control, providing protection against anxiety and emotional dysregulation during the more turbulent teenage years. 

* **Supporting Emotional Regulation** Emotional regulation develops through validating all feelings, modeling healthy coping strategies, and never punishing children for expressing distress. Building emotional vocabulary through words, pictures, or communication devices enables children to better manage emotions and ask for help when needed.

* **Compliance to collaboration** Around ages 9-10, some autistic children begin showing what others might call "non-compliance" - resistance to instructions or routines that don't feel right to them. The expectation that children must always comply can feel overwhelming and unfair, especially for autistic children who may need more control over their lives. Shifting away from strict compliance expectations and toward collaborative approaches works best when started before puberty begins.

## Redefining Educational Success

Autistics may face academic challenges during teen years due to the gaps in early learning. During primary schooling, many autistic children excel academically, possibly due to their strengths in pattern recognition and rote memory. However, as content becomes more abstract, particularly in mathematics and science, those without strong conceptual foundations may begin to struggle. If left unaddressed, this can also lead to academic withdrawal and school refusal.

We also need to relook at how we view success in education. Success in education for autistic teens must encompass more than academic progress. It should include emotional regulation, self-understanding, and the acquisition of practical life skills. Many teens perform well in structured tasks like memorization or pattern recognition yet struggle with the abstract thinking required in higher-level subjects. When adults respond only by increasing tutoring or academic pressure, teens may memorize without understanding, leading to boredom, frustration, and disengagement.

Essential Components of Meaningful Education include:

- Balance between academics and practical life skills
- Recognition of individual learning styles and processing differences
- Integration of emotional literacy into daily instruction
- Flexible approaches that honor neurodivergent ways of learning
- Focus on skills that contribute to future independence and confidence

### Supporting Educational Engagement{.unnumbered}

To maintain motivation and relevance, education must balance traditional academics with practical, real-world competencies. Learning to budget money, prepare meals, maintain personal hygiene, or navigate public transportation often holds more long-term value than test scores. These skills contribute directly to future independence and self-confidence.

Families remain essential advocates during this transition, regularly updating Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) to reflect changing needs, strengths, and interests. Educational systems must broaden their definition of success to include all forms of progress - academic, social, emotional, and functional - celebrating diverse achievements rather than only traditional academic milestones.
