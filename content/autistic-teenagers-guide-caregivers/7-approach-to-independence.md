## Approach to Independence: Redefining Autonomy

#### Beyond the Myth of "Doing It All Alone"{.unnumbered}

Society often defines independence as complete self-sufficiency - "doing it all alone." This narrow view creates exclusion for autistic individuals who may always need certain support, whether emotional, sensory, or social. Rather than viewing autistic teenagers as either "dependent" or "independent," it's more accurate to picture independence as a spectrum of support. One teen might handle academics easily but need regular emotional support. Another might thrive in self-care yet struggle with abstract thinking. Some may succeed in supported employment while building fulfilling lives through various paths. A neurodiversity-affirming approach recognizes that true independence is not about eliminating support but about maintaining dignity, decision-making power, and control over one's life while accessing necessary assistance. 

#### The Autistic Perspective: Independence as "The Ability to Take Help"{.unnumbered}

Autistic adults have offered a powerful reframing of independence: it's not about eliminating support but about being able to ask for and accept help without losing dignity or control. In practical terms, this might mean an autistic teen calling on a trusted adult during a meltdown, seeking support during confusing social situations, or using tools like sensory aids or communication devices to self-regulate.

These actions demonstrate resilience and self-awareness rather than dependence. They show that a young person understands their needs and can identify when they require assistance. Far from diminishing independence, this capacity to negotiate support represents a deeper form of agency.

#### Agency Exists Before Absolute Autonomy{.unnumbered}

A common misconception is that autistic individuals must achieve complete autonomy before their agency can be recognized. This denies teenagers the right to have their choices respected while they're still developing. Yet teenagers demonstrate agency in many everyday ways: refusing disliked foods, choosing between activities, asking for help during distress, or expressing discomfort. Each of these represents an act of agency. When adults dismiss these expressions as stubbornness or immaturity, teens receive the damaging message that their voice only matters once they become "fully independent" in neurotypical terms.

## Conclusion: A Holistic Approach to Supporting Autistic Teens

The teenage years in autism demand a fundamental shift from deficit-focused interventions to strengths-based, holistic support that honors the authentic autistic experience. The challenges faced during adolescence—from behavioral changes and educational struggles to developing independence and navigating relationships—are not individual failures but signals that our support systems need to evolve.

Success in supporting autistic teenagers requires:

* Early and Ongoing Preparation: Starting conversations and skill-building in pre-puberty (ages 9-10) creates foundations that can weather the storms of adolescence. This includes emotional literacy, boundary education, self-advocacy skills, and comprehensive understanding of physical and social changes.

* Redefining Independence: Moving beyond neurotypical definitions of independence as "doing everything alone" to embrace supported autonomy where teens can access help while maintaining agency and dignity. True independence is the ability to negotiate support while retaining control over one's life.

* Thoughtful Intervention: Whether considering medication, educational modifications, or therapeutic support, interventions should address underlying needs rather than simply managing symptoms. The goal is creating space for authentic engagement rather than compliance with neurotypical expectations.

* Comprehensive Education: Recognizing that education encompasses not just academics but emotional regulation, life skills, relationships, and sexuality. Success is measured not only in grades but in self-understanding, meaningful connections, and preparation for fulfilling adult life.

* Family and Community Partnership: Creating networks of support that extend beyond the family to include affirming educational settings, therapeutic relationships, and broader community acceptance. This includes connecting teens with neurodivergent adults and communities that model successful autistic lives.

The ultimate goal is not to make autistic teenagers appear "normal" but to support them in developing into confident, self-aware adults who can navigate the world on their own terms while accessing the support they need to thrive. When we approach the teenage years with this understanding, we honor both the challenges and the incredible potential of autistic young people, setting the stage for meaningful, authentic adult lives.

By recognizing that the difficulties of autistic adolescence often stem from unmet needs rather than inherent deficits, we can shift from crisis management to proactive support, from compliance-focused interventions to agency-building approaches, and from isolated individual treatment to comprehensive community understanding. This transformation benefits not only autistic teens and their families but enriches our entire understanding of human neurodiversity and potential.
