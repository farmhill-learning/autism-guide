# Ayurveda

Ayurveda, an ancient natural system of medicine said to have originated in India over 3,000 years ago, derives its name from the Sanskrit words "ayur" (life) and "veda" (science or knowledge), translating to “knowledge of life”. Advocates of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), such as Ayurveda, subscribe to the belief that the world operates in a state of balance. According to this perspective, optimal health is achieved when living creatures are in harmony with the universe. Conversely, disruptions in this balance are thought to lead to illnesses. Ayurveda treatment approaches health by focusing on restoring this balance as a means of addressing and treating various health conditions. It advocates for specific lifestyle interventions and natural therapies to restore balance among the body, mind, spirit, and the environment.

According to Ayurveda, every person is made of the five basic elements found in the universe: Air, water, fire, space and earth. Central to Ayurvedic medicine are concepts such as universal interconnectedness, the body's constitution (prakriti), and life forces (doshas). Treatment goals aim to eliminate impurities, alleviate symptoms, enhance disease resistance, reduce stress, and promote harmony in life. Treatment in Ayurveda commences with an internal purification process, followed by a tailored diet, herbal remedies, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation. Ayurvedic practitioners extensively use herbs, plants, oils, and common spices in their treatments.

In India, Ayurveda holds the status of a recognized form of medical care, alongside conventional Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathic medicine, and homeopathic medicine. When utilized as a complementary therapy alongside standard conventional medical care, Ayurveda has demonstrated some positive effects. However, it's crucial to note that many Ayurvedic materials have not undergone extensive research in both Western and Indian contexts. Some products used in Ayurvedic medicine may include herbs, metals, minerals, or other substances that could pose harm if used improperly or without the guidance of a trained practitioner. Therefore, caution and expert guidance are advised when considering Ayurvedic treatments.

### Ayurveda and Autism

The idea of using Ayurveda for autism is a relatively recent development and is part of the broader interest in alternative and complementary therapies for managing various health conditions. Ayurveda, as an ancient system of medicine, has a long history, but its application to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) gained attention in the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st century. There is limited scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of Ayurveda in improving autism symptoms. Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine, encompasses a holistic approach to health and well-being. While some proponents suggest that Ayurvedic practices may offer benefits for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it's crucial to note that research in this area is limited. The scientific community remains cautious about making definitive claims regarding the effectiveness of Ayurveda for autism.
Some individuals and families may explore Ayurveda as a complementary or alternative therapy for autism based on the following principles:

+ Holistic Approach: Ayurveda takes a holistic approach, considering the interconnectedness of the mind, body, and spirit. The belief is that balancing these aspects can contribute to overall health and well-being.
+ Individualized Treatment: Ayurvedic treatments are often individualized based on a person's unique constitution or dosha. The idea is that addressing specific imbalances in an individual's constitution may promote health and alleviate symptoms.
+ Dietary and Lifestyle Recommendations: Ayurveda places significant emphasis on dietary and lifestyle practices. Recommendations may include specific dietary modifications, the use of herbal remedies, and the incorporation of practices such as meditation, yoga, and breathing exercises.
+ Stress Reduction: Stress reduction is considered essential in Ayurveda for maintaining balance and preventing disease. Practices that promote relaxation and reduce stress, such as meditation and yoga, may be recommended.
+ Herbal Remedies: Ayurveda incorporates the use of herbal remedies, derived from plants and natural substances. Some herbal formulations in Ayurveda are believed to have properties that may support cognitive function and address symptoms associated with neurological conditions.

It's crucial to highlight the need for rigorous scientific research to establish the safety and effectiveness of Ayurveda in the context of autism. While anecdotal reports and individual testimonials may suggest positive outcomes, these do not substitute for well-designed clinical trials with large sample sizes and rigorous methodologies.

If individuals or families are considering Ayurveda for autism, it is strongly advised to consult with healthcare professionals, particularly those with expertise in autism. Integrating Ayurveda into an overall care plan in collaboration with conventional evidence-based interventions is essential. Open communication with healthcare providers ensures that any therapeutic approach aligns with the best interests and well-being of individuals with autism.

### History of Ayurveda

The history of Ayurveda is deeply rooted in ancient Indian civilization, and its principles have been passed down through oral traditions and written texts. Its foundations are deeply rooted in the ancient schools of Hindu Philosophical teachings, specifically the Vaisheshika school and the school of logic known as Nyaya. Additionally, Ayurveda is closely connected to the manifestation framework, commonly recognized as Samkhya. It emerged during the same period when the schools of Nyaya and Vaisheshika were flourishing. Ayurveda is also said to have a divine origin, believed to come from the Hindu God Brahma, who is considered the creator of the universe. Before the establishment of philosophical schools, this holistic knowledge of healing was passed from Brahma to sages, who then shared it with their disciples and the general population through writings and spoken stories. They described the healing properties of herbs in poetic verses called "Shlokas."

Ayurveda's foundation lies in four important collections of knowledge called Vedas. The Rig Veda, the most famous among them, talks about 67 plants and 1028 Shlokas. The Atharva Veda and Yajur Veda mention 293 and 81 plants with medicinal uses, respectively. Ayurveda's practice is deeply rooted in the insights gained from these ancient Vedas.
Following is an overview of the history of Ayurveda:

+ Vedic Period (1500 BCE - 600 BCE): The earliest roots of Ayurveda can be traced back to the Vedic period in ancient India. The knowledge of Ayurveda is believed to be part of the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. The Rigveda, one of the Vedic texts, contains hymns related to healing and the use of medicinal plants.
+ Compilation of Ayurvedic Texts (600 BCE - 200 CE): The foundational texts of Ayurveda, known as the "Samhitas," were compiled during this period. The most significant among them are the Charaka Samhita, attributed to the sage Charaka (physician), and the Sushruta Samhita, attributed to the sage Sushruta (surgeon). These texts cover various aspects of health, disease, diagnosis, treatment, and surgical procedures.
+ Golden Age of Ayurveda (200 CE - 1200 CE): During this period, Ayurveda flourished and became more organized. The works of influential scholars such as Vagbhata contributed to the development and systematization of Ayurvedic knowledge. The Ashtanga Hridaya, written by Vagbhata, is an important compendium that synthesized earlier Ayurvedic teachings.
+ Islamic Influence (1200 CE - 1800 CE): With the advent of Islamic rule in India, Ayurveda faced challenges but continued to evolve. Some Ayurvedic texts were translated into Arabic, and Unani medicine, influenced by Ayurveda, emerged as a distinct medical tradition.
+ Colonial Period (17th Century Onward): The colonial period saw the arrival of European powers in India. The British East India Company established control, and Ayurveda faced challenges during this period. The British colonial authorities initially viewed Ayurveda with skepticism.
+ Revival Efforts (Late 19th Century - 20th Century): The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed efforts to revive and institutionalize Ayurveda. Key figures such as Swami Dayananda Saraswati and Mahatma Gandhi emphasized the importance of traditional Indian systems of medicine, including Ayurveda.
+ Post-Independence Era (1947 Onward): After India gained independence in 1947, there were renewed efforts to promote and modernize Ayurveda. The establishment of institutions, research centers, and government initiatives aimed at preserving and promoting Ayurvedic knowledge.
+ Global Recognition and Integration (Late 20th Century Onward): In recent decades, there has been a growing global interest in Ayurveda. It has gained recognition as an alternative and complementary system of medicine worldwide. Ayurvedic practices, including herbal remedies, dietary recommendations, and lifestyle interventions, have found a place in integrative medicine approaches.

Today, Ayurveda continues to be practiced in India and other parts of the world. It has influenced various alternative and complementary medicine practices and is recognized for its holistic approach to health and well-being. Despite its rich history, it's important to note that scientific validation and standardization of Ayurvedic practices remain ongoing challenges.

### Caution
While some individuals and families may consider exploring Ayurveda as a complementary or alternative therapy for autism, it's important to approach it with caution and consider several factors. Here are some key points to keep in mind when seeking Ayurveda for autism:

+ Limited Scientific Evidence: There is limited scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of Ayurveda specifically for autism. Rigorous research, including well-designed clinical trials, is needed to establish its safety and effectiveness.
+ Individual Variability in Responses: Responses to Ayurvedic treatments can vary among individuals. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex and heterogeneous condition, and what works for one person may not work for another. Factors such as the severity of symptoms and overall health can influence individual responses.
+ Integration with Conventional Care: Ayurvedic approaches should be viewed as complementary rather than a substitute for evidence-based interventions recommended by healthcare providers. It's important to communicate openly with healthcare professionals, including those with expertise in autism, to ensure that Ayurveda is integrated into an overall care plan.
+ Safety Considerations: While Ayurveda is generally considered safe when practiced by trained practitioners, it's crucial to ensure that any herbal remedies or dietary recommendations align with the individual's overall health. Consult with healthcare professionals, especially if the individual is on any medications or has pre-existing health conditions.
+ Consultation with Qualified Practitioners: Seek Ayurvedic treatments from qualified practitioners who have training and experience in Ayurveda. Professional Ayurvedic practitioners may have certifications or qualifications from recognized institutions. Verify their credentials before starting any treatment.
+ Transparency and Informed Consent: Practitioners should be transparent about the nature of Ayurvedic treatments, potential benefits, and possible risks. Informed consent is essential, and individuals or caregivers should be fully informed about what to expect from Ayurvedic interventions.
+ Monitoring Progress: Regularly monitor the individual's progress and communicate with healthcare providers. If any concerns or unexpected changes arise, it's important to discuss them with both Ayurvedic practitioners and conventional healthcare professionals.
+ Financial Considerations: Consider the financial implications of Ayurvedic treatments, as some interventions may involve costs. Be aware of any potential financial burden and ensure that the chosen approach aligns with the overall budget for healthcare.
+ Cultural Sensitivity: Ayurveda is deeply rooted in Indian culture, and cultural sensitivity is important. Ensure that practitioners understand and respect the cultural context and preferences of the individuals and families seeking Ayurvedic care.
+ Ongoing Communication: Establish open and ongoing communication between Ayurvedic practitioners and other healthcare providers involved in the individual's care. Collaboration can contribute to a more comprehensive and integrated approach.

It's important to recognize that individual experiences with Ayurveda may vary, and what works for one person may not work for another. For individuals or families considering Ayurveda for autism, consulting healthcare professionals, especially those knowledgeable about autism, is strongly advised. Integrating Ayurveda into an overall care plan should be a collaborative effort with healthcare providers familiar with both Ayurvedic principles and conventional evidence-based approaches to autism. Open communication ensures that any therapeutic approach aligns with the best interests and well-being of individuals with autism.
