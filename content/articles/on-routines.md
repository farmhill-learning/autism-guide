What makes for a good day, leaving us content? Engagement through the day with age-appropriate physical activity, cognitive stimulation as well as social exposure tends to lead to good days. Such an engagement gives a sense of contentment and satisfaction to the individual. That’s when we say, we are ‘at peace’. This applies across age groups, across diverse populations.

In this modern era of countless distractions, with each activity designed to be addictive, a routine becomes important if one wants to achieve even a modicum of contentment.

However, maintaining a daily or weekly routine is a much detested and more criticized idea. Many people explicitly try to not have a routine, and it becomes a routine not to have a routine. In this pursuit of non-routine, their goals and to-do lists become haphazard. Even when they clear a part of the list, they tend to feel overwhelmed with what is left and are not able to appreciate either their effort or achievement.

Routine is often negatively associated with living in a hostel. Why do hostels have routines in the first place? Is it to make everyone’s life difficult? When a group of people live together, routine helps with predictability and to plan our lives in the presence of each other. We are usually okay with following the routines in schools, workplaces, and when on trips. When it comes to family, we take the caregivers for granted and refuse to follow a predictable routine. We don’t think twice before informing them at the last minute that we don’t want breakfast or we go to eat whenever we want and they are supposed to provide hot food. People think this is luxury and comfortable living whereas it is just their life going off track.
