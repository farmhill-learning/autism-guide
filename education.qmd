# Education & Schooling

When considering schooling and education options for their children on the autism spectrum, parents often start with: "Can my child go to school?" Sometimes this question is also phrased as a need - “my child needs to go to school. How will he get an education otherwise?” This seemingly simple thought opens the doors on a variety of questions and concerns that parents often struggle with. 

However, before addressing this question, it's important to think about what schooling and education mean and how they are different. Education is the acquisition of knowledge through formal learning and instruction. In contrast, schooling pertains to obtaining an education within a formal school setup. This difference is important as it helps us move beyond mere attendance and focus on a comprehensive educational journey for children on the autism spectrum. While we are at a point to choose between the both, it is worthy to note that education is more important than schooling.

Recognizing that traditional education systems may pose challenges for autistic children is the key. Unlike neurotypical children, the learning experience for autistic children can be difficult within conventional educational frameworks. This realization sets the stage for reimagining education to better suit the unique needs of children with autism.

In this section, we address a few questions, concerns and thoughts relating to education and schooling for children on the spectrum. For the purposes of this section, the children we are talking about are 5-16 year olds.
