# Education & Schooling

When considering schooling and education options for their children on the autism spectrum, parents often start with: "Can my child go to school?" Sometimes this question is also phrased as a need - “my child needs to go to school. How will he get an education otherwise?” This seemingly simple thought opens the doors on a variety of questions and concerns that parents often struggle with.

:::

The short answer to "Can my child go to school?" is yes, but the more important question is, “Should they, and if so, under what conditions?” It is important to note that it is not just about academic abilities. Readiness for school depends upon a wider set of prerequisite skills—communication (verbal or non-verbal), the ability to self-regulate, engage in social or learning routines with support, and manage transitions and the unpredictability that comes with a group setting. If these skills are still developing, a better question to ask is, “Will school help my child build these skills or will it overwhelm them?”

However, before addressing this question, it's important to think about what schooling and education mean and how they are different. Education is the acquisition of knowledge through formal learning and instruction. In contrast, schooling pertains to obtaining an education within a formal school setup. This difference is important as it helps us move beyond mere attendance and focus on a comprehensive educational journey for children on the autism spectrum. While we are at a point to choose between the both, it is worthy to note that education is more important than schooling.

Recognizing that traditional education systems may pose challenges for autistic children is important. Unlike neurotypical children, the learning experience for autistic children can be difficult within conventional educational frameworks. This realization sets the stage for reimagining education to better suit the unique needs of children with autism.

In this section, we address a few questions, concerns and thoughts relating to education and schooling for children on the spectrum. For the purposes of this section, the children we are talking about are 5-11 year olds.

## What can School do?

Schooling can ideally help the child in getting social exposure, opportunities for peer interaction, academic and cognitive stimulation and a structured environment for skill development. However, the child will be met with the advantages of going to a school only if they are supported, understood and included meaningfully. If a child is struggling to keep up with the demands, or facing social exclusion, the benefits of school may never materialize and it can cost the mental health of the child. Parents are often told or they believe that the child will learn from being around their peers by observing and imitating, which works wonders for many children, but the assumption may be flawed for children having challenges in imitation or understanding social cues. Autistic kids often lack imitation skills or they imitate without full understanding. They may copy speech or behavior, but may not comprehend the meaning or intent. As a parent, one has to examine and have clarity on:

* What are the skills we want them to learn? - Is it responding to a teacher, sharing, social interaction or just sitting in a group?

* What is the nature of each of these skills? - Is it something they’ll pick up naturally like walking or is it something that requires specified instructions like writing or reading?

* What is the nature of the learning process for the child? - Can the child learn from the environment or does the child require structured, step by step instructions?

Here is an analogy to understand this better. Imagine you want to teach the child to swim. One can take two approaches to teaching swimming:

* Throw the child at the deep end of the pool and expect the child to start swimming as human bodies are naturally designed to swim.

* Teach the child with guided instructions

Now, with the first approach, some may learn, while others may struggle and panic. Similarly, putting a completely inexperienced driver in the driving seat of a car in the middle of traffic and leaving them to “figure it out” on the road can turn out to be extremely dangerous and irresponsible of the trainer too. 

Throwing them in the deep end or leaving them to "figure it out" might be what we end up doing to an autistic child, when we place them in a classroom without ensuring they understand the environment, they have the skills to participate meaningfully and that they are safe, seen and supported. This is not teaching, it is more of hoping. 

The downside of starting with a mainstream school without taking the child’s readiness into account can look like - struggle with meltdowns after school, identity confusion, anxiety, accepting bullying, etc. Autistic children are often expected to “fit in” with neurotypical norms, and many quickly learn to mask their difficulties or develop unhealthy coping behaviours in order to avoid being judged or excluded. These behaviours can be mistaken for successful adaptations but they are likely to take a toll on their mental health in the long run.

## School Readiness

Readiness for school is often equated to chronological age or cognitive abilities. But for an autistic child, it is not just about the ABCs and 123s. School readiness involves a broader functional set of skills which help them navigate and benefit out of a group environment - being able to engage, communicate and learn in a shared space. School readiness in the child can look like:

* Being able to communicate their needs - communication doesn’t equate speech (Read more on [speech vs. communication](https://autism.farmhill.in/early-intervention.html#autism-speech-and-communication)). Whether verbal or non-verbal, the child should have a reliable method of communication. It can be through speech or gestures or visuals or using assistive technology. It is important because it facilitates participation in class, seeking help and expressing discomfort, if any.

* Being able to handle separation from the primary caregiver - the child should be able to stay away from the caregiver for a period of time without significant distress. This can be built gradually with support.

* Ability to self-regulate or co-regulate - A packed school day full of transitions can get overwhelming for autistic children. They should be able to use calming strategies or be open to receiving help from adults to navigate challenges like waiting, turn taking or emotional ups and downs

* Ability to participate in a group - The child should be ready or be gradually supported to be a part of a shared space, among peers and adults. Apart from social interaction, group readiness also means ability to follow group rules and routines, managing the noise and navigating the social dynamics. 

* Ability to access the learning - learning could be through visuals or by observing or even a small group (1:3) support, but the child should be able to access the learning i.e be receptive to the learning. Learning can be social skills or academics or functional skills. 

### Prerequisite skills - preschool and primary school

Preschools are often the first structured social environment a child is exposed to. For an autistic kid, this requires careful planning. The focus here again should not be solely on age, but the readiness. Key prerequisite skills include:

* Basic communication - the child should have a functional way to express their needs

* Separation tolerance - the child should be able to be away from the primary caregiver for a brief duration without extreme distress

* Tolerance for group settings - the ability to stay in a space with others without distress or disruptive behaviors

* Regulation - being able to regulate emotions with support

* Awareness of and interest in peers- ability to show interest in others even if not interacting as much.

At the primary school level, the environment becomes more demanding. There is an expectation of sustained attention, task completion, and social cooperation.

* Understanding and following routines: the child should be able to follow structured daily routines with some predictability.

* Attention span: the ability to stay engaged in an activity for at least 10–15 minutes with adult support.

* Instruction comprehension: understanding simple one- or two-step instructions.

* Emotional regulation skills: cope with changes, handle sensory inputs, and seek help when distressed.

* Academic foundations: Foundational academic skills have to be in place for a meaningful learning experience - recognition of letters, numbers, colors or at least emerging pre-academic skills.

## What can education look like  

Without the prerequisite skills, school can become a space of confusion and anxiety, hindering growth. However, readiness does not equate complete independence. Readiness includes components such as the capacity for the child to participate in a group with support, the presence of an environment that scaffolds their needs and a team that works collaboratively.

Therefore, let the child lead the decision. The goal is not just school attendance. It also includes meaningful learning and development. Whether that happens in a classroom, in nature or at a kitchen table, the right path should fit your child’s current strengths, needs and comfort. The path need not be what is typical or expected. 

So the relevant questions is - will my child be able to learn the skills I hope he/she will learn if they go to school. If yes, then it makes sense to look for a school environment that supports these goals. The child should be in a position to deal with the social and cognitive demands of going to a school. If not, our next question can be: is going to school the only way to learn these skills? To which the answer is a firm no. The alternatives include:

* Mainstream school with support - shadow teachers or inclusive education aids, an Individualised Education Plan (IEP) driven integration with goals tailored to the child.

* Special Education Schools, where there is likely be focused attention and specialized curriculum to meet the needs of the child and an environment with reduced sensory overload.

* Alternate schools (Waldorff, Montessori etc) - schools that follow a different curriculum from the mainstream schools, it is more flexible with the sensory needs, mixed age groups and experiential learning.

* Homeschooling - parents or guardians take responsibility for the child’s learning outside of traditional school setting. It gives the space for specialised curriculum, targeted interventions and sensory accommodations. Socialization and peer interaction can be tailored to the child’s comfort level and interests. Parents can join hands with other neurodivergent families and create a homeschooling community including experts from the field. It requires a considerable amount of  parent's time and effort, but allows for complete customisation of the child’s education plan to suit their strengths, interests and challenges.

These alternatives can be temporary or long term based on the child’s evolving needs. These are not limiting opportunities, but ensures that the opportunities are appropriate, accessible and beneficial. School can be a wonderful place for growth, but only when the environment matches the child’s readiness and the learning process suits their way of processing the world. It is very important that the child is learning safely, authentically and with joy.

## What should children learn at this age?

As parents find a suitable learning environment for the child, another related question is what should the child learn at this age. This can also be used to assess whether the environment chosen for the child is working or not. Here is a general understanding of the developmental goals during the early schooling (5-11 year olds) that is meaningful for the child’s growth.

A learning environment is often seen as a place of learning to read, write and do math. While these are important, learning, especially at this young age, should include broader aspects for neurodivergent children. They need opportunities to learn how to relate to others, understand emotions, regulate oneself, build a sense of self and engage meaningfully with the world around them - growth across all developmental areas should be nurtured. Core developmental domains include:

* Physical development - gross motor and fine motor skills, body awareness and co-ordination and self-care routines

* Cognitive development - Problem solving and reasoning, exploration and curiosity, understanding cause and effect and foundational concepts - numbers, shapes, time, patterns, letters

* Communication and language development - expressing needs, feelings and thoughts, listening and following instructions, building vocabulary and using functional language, understanding social language (greeting, turn taking etc)

* Socio-emotional learning - recognising and understanding emotions, developing empathy and perspective taking, forming relationships, regulating emotions, beginning to advocate for their needs

* Executive functioning - Attention and focus, planning and task initiation, flexible thinking and impulse control

* Functional life skills - asking for help, participating in routines, transitioning between tasks, time management, personal hygiene and grooming, cleaning, eating, expressing needs

* Leisure skills - activities that children engage in for fun, relaxation and creative expression - games/ sports, art and craft, music, dance etc.

* Academically, pre-literacy (story listening, sound awareness, letter recognition), early numeracy (counting, comparing quantities, patterns), matching, sorting, categorizing and learning through play and experience 

Essentially, what matters is how a child learns more than what a child learns. A learning environment that honors play as a learning tool, especially for kids this age, promotes deep learning and engagement as play gives the opportunity for children to develop their problem solving, imagination and negotiation skills. Ultimately, the goal of early schooling should be to lay the foundation for a lifelong love of learning and connection.

## How does a learning environment look like

Just like the child is assessed for readiness, it is important to look for an environment that supports the child’s growth. The learning space should be more than just a place of instructions and accommodations. Finding the best fit can be overwhelming, but rather than worrying if the school will take the child, a more empowering question to ask is “Does the school/ environment have what it takes to support my child? Is the school or environment prepared to support my child?” For an autistic child, it should be a space where they are understood, accepted and meaningfully included in the learning process.The following are some basic factors to look for:

* Neurodiversity awareness - An environment that understands neurodiversity must go beyond surface-level accommodations. It must embrace the diversity of brain types and recognise that autistic thinking, feeling, and learning are different and not necessarily deficient. Ask questions like: 

  - Is neurodiversity a part of staff training or classroom conversations?
 
  - Are behaviours interpreted through a strengths-based lens, instead of being problematized?

  - Are children supported to self-advocate or express boundaries?

A truly inclusive culture is likely to be visible in the language used around neurodivergence, the materials in the classroom, and the way the people in the environment approach neurodiversity.

* Meaningful inclusion - Inclusion in its real sense means that every child has access to learning, participation, and peer interaction in ways that work for them. Inclusion is not about just placing a child in the same room as everyone else and letting them be. Look for:

  - Teachers who differentiate instructions and use visual, kinesthetic, or play-based strategies.

  - Flexible seating, modified tasks, and support to participate in group routines, without forcing conformity.

  - A culture where differences are normalised and not hidden or masked.

Inclusion does not mean expecting autistic children to imitate neurotypical peers at the cost of their own regulation or identity. It means adapting the environment so all children can learn and belong.

* Response to sensory and emotional needs - Many autistic children have challenges with sensory processing, transitions and emotional regulation. The school should see them as needs to be met with appropriate strategies rather than as a problem to be fixed. Some relevant questions are:

  - Is the environment flexible to sensory needs - are there quiet corners, or allowance of movement breaks?

  - How do teachers respond to emotional distress or shutdowns? Is co-regulation part of the approach? Are teachers equipped with calming strategies?

  - Are transitions between activities paced with visual schedules or routines to support predictability?

Children shouldn't be expected to "cope" on their own. A responsive environment anticipates needs and is ready to support them rather than reacting to behaviours.

* Ongoing training for teachers and non-teaching staff - Inclusion without sensitisation is incomplete. In order to be inclusive, the environment requires prepared adults and a space that supports the child's way of being. Teachers are the foundation of a child’s school experience and every school that admits autistic children must commit to ongoing training for its staff. This should ideally include:

  - Fostering an understanding of autism and neurodivergence beyond clinical labels.

  - Familiarity and fluency in communication strategies like AAC, visual schedules, or gestures.

  - Training in regulation techniques like co-regulation, sensory support, and flexible expectations.

  - Training for non-teaching staff as well - transport workers, helpers, and administrative staff, so the entire school ecosystem feels safe and inclusive.

Without proper training, autistic children are often misunderstood. Teachers, too, face stress and burnout when they’re not equipped to support neurodivergent students. Sensitisation is learning to recognise distress, respond with empathy, adapt communication, and create safe, inclusive spaces. It helps teachers understand children's behaviour as a way of communication, replacing control with connection.

* Curriculum that goes beyond academics - Autistic children may have unique learning pathways. Academic skills are only one part of a child’s development. One has to know whether the school values, focuses and supports holistic growth, which can look like the curriculum focusing on and including:

  - Physical development: fine motor, gross motor, and self-care routines.

  - Cognitive skills: improving problem-solving, understanding cause-effect, memory, and attention.

  - Social-emotional learning: recognising emotions, building relationships, coping with change.

  - Functional life skills: following routines, managing transitions, using tools (e.g., cutlery, bags, visual schedules).

  - Leisure skills: engaging in play, art, music, or other recreational activities that offer joy and regulation.

A meaningful learning environment should support holistic development of the child, and not just the usual academic checklists.

Some questions you can pose to the management to understand a learning environment that you are looking to place your child in are:

* What support systems are in place for neurodivergent learners?

* Is there any special educator or an inclusion expert on staff?

* How are the teachers trained to support emotional and sensory regulation?

* Can the curriculum be adapted to meet my child’s learning pace and style?

* What is your approach to behaviour - do you use reward/punishment systems, or do you look at underlying needs?

* Are there spaces for downtime or sensory breaks?

* How do you work with families to create individualised plans?

Hence, it is not just about the child being ready for a shared learning space, but also finding a learning space that is ready for your child. 

## Inclusion - What it is and What it is not

“Inclusion is not a destination, but an approach.”

Inclusion is not about making autistic children less autistic. It does not operate from the belief that children will grow out of autism by being in an inclusive setup. It is also not just about the space - just because they are physically present in the space, does not mean a child is included.  If they are physically present, but are not attended to emotionally or no facilitation of meaningful learning takes place, inclusion has failed in that space.

Inclusion is often misunderstood as including children with special needs in a regular classroom. It goes deep beyond that, creating an environment where all the children irrespective of their neurological profile, physical ability, pace of learning, socioeconomic background, and any other differences, have equal access to the learning process and the curriculum being provided in the environment. It requires a fundamental shift in the system to remove barriers and meet the diverse needs of the children. Inclusive systems value the unique contributions students of all backgrounds bring to the classroom and allow diverse groups to grow side by side, to the benefit of all.

An inclusive system is built on the belief that a diverse classroom enriches the learning experience. The classroom culture promotes belonging - where everyone feels accepted, understood and valued. It could also include adults from diverse backgrounds or neurological profiles. In practical terms, it means:

* Teachers are trained to work with children with various academic and other abilities
* The system recognises different learning styles and paces as well as different ways of participating
* The curriculum is flexible to adapt to different learners
* There is time, space and energy built into the syste, to provide the required support - visuals, support teachers, sensory spaces, small group learning settings, extra academic support, emotional support etc. etc to help children access learning in a way that would work for them
* The classroom culture promotes belonging - every child is participating, valued and accepted.
* The environment reflects diversity among the adults who shape the learning environment, including teachers, aides, administrators, and support staff.

 “Inclusivity is actually maintained when all members of a group are able to participate in its activities, which means, provisions made are considerate of all members and not just those from specific groups or, with special abilities, disabilities, and/or needs.”

It's about making school a place where they can grow, learn, be themselves and feel respected. When classrooms/ systems are designed with multiple needs in mind, they become more flexible, compassionate, and effective learning environments for every student.

### Why is inclusion important?

Inclusion in education promotes equity, belonging and social change. It ensures all the children regardless of their abilities or learning styles, have meaningful learning experiences. For children who might have otherwise been excluded, inclusive systems provide a safe space for authentic expression allowing the child to thrive in his/her own terms.

Beyond the individual, inclusion enriches the entire ecosystem. It challenges stereotypes, reduces stigma and fosters empathy and collaboration among children and educators. In doing so, it paves the way to create a more just and equitable society, where differences are valued and not just accommodated.

## Supporting autism in the school

Now that schools are being called upon to meaningfully include diverse children, the role of schools and teachers requires intention, preparation and commitment. How should the school approach and support the admission of an autistic kid into the environment?

Before admission, schools should consider:

* Assessment of readiness from both sides - just as a child’s readiness is essential, so is the school's. Does the school have the capacity - resources, training, and flexibility to provide a meaningful learning experience for the child?

* Having a trained professional on board - Is there a professional on staff who will work with teachers to individualize instruction, adapt materials, and support the child’s specific needs?

* Facility to involve shadow teachers or give one to one support - some children benefit greatly from a dedicated support person to navigate through the school routine. This person would ideally serve as a bridge between the child, teacher, and peers.

* Clear criteria for admission - the criteria for admitting an autistic child should be clear and the school should ensure that adequate support is in place. If the school cannot support the child, the school should be honest with its limitations and if possible try building on the capacity to include the child

* Accommodations and flexibility - From sensory-friendly spaces and visual schedules to adapted assignments and adjusted expectations, schools must be ready to make accommodations not as exceptions, but as part of inclusive practice.

Once admitted, the school holds certain minimum responsibilities towards the learning journey of the child to make it meaningful and supportive:

* Curating an IEP - An IEP is a roadmap tailored to the child’s goals, strengths, challenges, and supports required. It should be created in collaboration with the family and revised regularly.

* Regular meeting with parents - Parents and caregivers are experts in their child’s needs. Their involvement in setting goals and reviewing progress is essential.

* Sensitisation and training for staff - All teachers and staff should receive basic training in neurodiversity, sensory regulation, emotional support strategies, and inclusive classroom practices.

### Support for the teachers 

As a teacher, one can expect the following support to facilitate meaningful experience for an autistic child:

* Training in Inclusive Practices: understanding autism, communication styles, sensory processing, and behavior from a needs-based lens is foundational.

* Team Support: access to a special educator, therapist, or mentor with whom they can consult, plan, and troubleshoot. A collaborative team makes inclusion sustainable.

* Classroom adaptation: Inclusion often requires shifting the way a classroom works - incorporating visual supports, allowing movement breaks, using predictable routines, offering multiple ways to demonstrate learning, and being flexible with acceptable behaviors should be allowed.

* Reasonable Workload: teachers cannot be expected to carry all the emotional and logistical responsibility alone. Schools should ensure that classrooms are not overcrowded, that support staff are available, and that expectations are realistic.

By investing in training, collaboration, and meaningful accommodations, schools can become spaces where autistic children are not just present, but are understood, supported, and empowered to learn in their own way.


## Video - Education for All - schooling issues in autism

In the video below, Giselle Lobo, a special educator and head of inclusive education services at [Sethu](https://sethu.in), Goa, addresses parents to help them understand what goes into making choices for finding the right school and to provide them with a few guidelines when it comes to selecting a school for their children. Here is a summry:

* making a decision where to place your child in which school to place your child is extremely difficult especially for parents of kids with autism
* in order to make the right choice as to which school you are going to admit your child into you have to have a very good understanding of your child - the level of skills that your child has in self-help, being able to follow instructions and play
* you also need to understand the background of the school does the school welcome children is it willing to be accommodative, modify curriculum and the environment to support your child
* you also need to be aware of the curriculum that your child will benefit from most a functional curriculum or an academic curriculum 
* do you have the option to place your child in a mainstream school with a life skills resource room or an academic resource room 
* and finally, be aware of the supports your child needs - a visual schedule, a shadow teacher, buddies, activity based instruction, and see if the school is willing to provide them
