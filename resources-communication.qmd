# Resource: Communication

## Building pre-verbal Communication

Here is a video by Anjali Barretto, a speech therapist at [Sethu](https://sethu.in), Goa on building pre-verbal communication. Key points she mentions are:

* Engagement is the building block of communication
* when your child is having fun the chances that they engage and communicate with you is much higher so play every day 
* remember to follow your child's lead
* change the way you speak 
* pause or wait and then respond 
* manipulate the home environment to encourage your child to use whatever communication skills they have 




*Please note that these interventions are shared for general guidance. Designing and executing interventions - more importantly - noticing how the child responds and modifying the interventions so the child does not get distressed, is a specialist job. Consult qualified therapists as necessary.*
