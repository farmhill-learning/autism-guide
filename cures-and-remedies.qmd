# Why do people seek alternative treatments?

There are many alternative treatments or protocols advised for conditions like diabetes, skin allergies or even cancer. Similarly, there have been many alternative treatments that have been and continue to be practiced for autism, despite no evidence of effectiveness. In some cases, people believe in and are willing to try alternative approaches, even when there is evidence of harm. 

What prompts people to try these approaches, against all reason? 


### Newly discovered conditions

When a condition is newly discovered or becomes widespread, and an effective treatment is yet to be determined, it is typical for people to explore a range of potential causes, treatments and “cures”. An approach that might have been effective for a different condition that appears to be related may be tried. For example, in the case of COVID, when the infection hit, there was no cure. Healthcare workers primarily focused on providing symptomatic treatment and tried approaches that worked for other infections and respiratory conditions like flu. A variety of treatments ranging from allopathy, ayurveda to homeopathy were tried before a vaccine was developed and a protocol that works was devised. 

### Seeking better results with less effort

Even when some understanding and evidence-based interventions are available, there might be a desire to seek alternative solutions in the hope of achieving better or anticipated results, and with lesser effort. For example, it is understood that diabetes cannot be cured but can be managed with lifestyle changes. Many people find these lifestyle changes difficult to make and maintain. They seek alternative approaches instead. 

### Inability to critically evaluate 

It is also possible that people may not have the mental capacity to critically evaluate the feasibility of promised cures versus the potential harm as they deal with the stress placed by the condition they are dealing with. Sometimes they also believe that they have tried everything there is to try and there is no harm in trying one more thing. You see this approach in people dealing with cancer and such life threatening conditions. 

## The case of autism

Many of these factors seem to be working in the case of people who are willing to try alternative treatments for autism. Autism has been a poorly understood condition whose cause is not clearly known. It impacts children and it is no secret that many of us do not understand parenting, education and child development well enough. When a child is diagnosed with autism, parents do not immediately understand all the implications and its lifelong impact. Many see it as improper behavior on the child’s part or a set of symptoms that are preventing the child from going to school and seek to address them quickly, in time for the child to join a school. They also hear from healthcare professionals that there is no medical cure for autism. The evidence based interventions are behavioral, requiring significant time, energy and resource commitment from everyone involved. Most people are stressed out with the effort of bringing up the child and an autism diagnosis just makes things worse.  

It is in such an environment that alternative approaches, promising cures or at least significant improvements quickly, with little or no effort, become popular. Some of these are approaches that work for another condition, e.g. chelation, which is a treatment for heavy metal toxicity. Chelation was tried for autism initially because symptoms of autism resembled mercury poisoning and later because people believed autism was caused by mercury from vaccines. Similarly, hyperbaric oxygen therapy works for traumatic brain injury and was tried for autism because people believed increasing oxygen supply to the brain can help autism. There is homeopathy, which has been tried for everything that is not well understood in current medical science. In the Indian context, there is ayurveda, siddha and other alternative systems offering everything from remedies to cures for autism. Many others like restrictive diets are approaches that claim to cure a wide variety of conditions. 

## Caution: Alternative approaches 

Currently, we understand Autism as a brain wired differently. Symptoms of autism may pose some social challenges for individuals in the spectrum, for which one can seek symptomatic treatment to enable a functional and meaningful life within the society. The cause of autism is unclear and so is the cure for autism. Scientifically, no evidence supports the existence of a "cure" for autism. Evidence-based interventions aim to manage specific symptoms, yet other interventions driven by speculative theories of "curing" autism not only lack efficacy but can also result in severe side effects. Consequently, interventions that demand careful attention and caution include:

+ Chelation
+ Stem cell therapy
+ Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)
+ Homeopathy - Secretin
+ Ayurveda
+ Restrictive diets

## When to be critical 

Some treatments might appear appealing due to their success in addressing a different condition with similar symptoms, success stories from certain individuals, or alignment with personal beliefs or expectations of a cure. However, it is important to exercise serious caution when the intervention is promoted in the following ways:

+ The treatment lacks substantial scientific evidence or is based on unverified claims.
+ There is pressure or persuasion to adopt the intervention without clear and transparent information about its potential risks.
+ The treatment is presented as a "miracle cure" or a one-size-fits-all solution for a complex condition like autism.
+ Claims of success are primarily anecdotal and not supported by reliable research or clinical evidence.
+ The intervention involves risks or potentially harmful side effects that are not adequately addressed or disclosed.

## A guide to decision making

Distinguishing between legitimate therapies and questionable ones can be challenging, particularly when conventional approaches seem ineffective for parents of autistic children. While alternative treatments may, in some cases, offer assistance, it's crucial to recognize that no single method is universally effective for treating autism. If you are contemplating a non-traditional option, the following questions can guide your decision-making process:

+ Who is recommending this option and what do they have to gain if you accept?
+ What do reliable sources such as the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) or NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) or The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) have to say about this particular method?
+ What do established organizations led by people living with autism, such as the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN), Action for Autism (AFA) and the Autistic Women and Nonbinary Network (AWN) have to say about this therapy?
+ Is this method aimed at "curing" autism?
+ What are the potential risks related to using this treatment?
+ What methods are in place to ensure the person's safety?
+ How will you measure changes or improvements?

# Chelation - A Dangerous approach
::: {.callout-caution}
Chelation is not recommended for autism. It can have dangerous side effects.
:::

## What is chelation?

In chelation, the aim is to administer medications (chelators) that bind with metals in the body and remove it from the system via urine when the medicine itself is excreted. This has been useful to treat heavy metal toxicity. Most commonly used medications are dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). This treatment is typically administered intravenously or orally under medical supervision following a detailed baseline assessment of metal content in the system, usually with a urine test.

## History of chelation

Chelation process dates back to 1935 when it was used as binding and extracting agent of calcium in the dyeing industry. The use of Chelation therapy in humans started between the 1950s and 1960s when it was used in patients with hypercalcemia and lead poisoning, consequently showing improvements in their cardiovascular condition. Since then it has been established as an effective treatment for lead poisoning or any heavy metal toxicity for that matter and as anticoagulants. Between 2002 and 2007, despite several warnings and prohibitions by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), chelation gained popularity in the U.S. for treating heart conditions and other health issues. 

However, due to its intensity and potential harmful side effects, it is strictly administered under medical supervision.
In 1989, a "Protocol for the Safe and Effective Administration of EDTA" was established and later updated. This comprehensive protocol establishes strict criteria for patient selection and urges clinicians to conduct an initial assessment of renal function using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. It further emphasizes the continuous monitoring of renal function throughout a series of chelation treatments. Additionally, emergency procedures are outlined in case of adverse reactions during the process.

## Why was Chelation tried for autism?

It gained attention in the context of autism due to concerns about heavy metal toxicity in the systems of individuals in the spectrum, but scientific research hasn't supported the theory that autism is caused by heavy metal toxicity. Some studies have suggested that children with autism may have higher levels of certain heavy metals in their systems, but the direct cause between heavy metal exposure and autism has not been established. One hypothesis that autism is caused due to exposure to heavy metals (mercury) through vaccines has been studied thoroughly and research suggests no causal link between vaccines and autism. Other theories of autism being caused due to intrauterine or environmental exposure to heavy metals is still under study and there is no established link as of now.

On the other hand, scientific research investigating the effectiveness of chelation therapy for autism remains limited and inconclusive. Clinical trials investigating the impact of chelation on autism symptoms have shown mixed or inconclusive results, and many of these studies have methodological limitations.

## Caution

Chelation therapy can be risky and has the potential for serious side effects such as hypocalcaemia (level of calcium in blood is too low), renal impairment and reported deaths. The presence of certain metals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, chromium, potassium, sodium, and zinc is essential to facilitate normal biological functioning of the human body. It is a cause for concern if there are lower or higher levels of these metals than what is required. It necessitates meticulous and supervised administration of medications to avoid excessive removal of metals. Medical organizations do not recommend chelation therapy for autism due to safety concerns.

Some researchers also suggest that due to the greater risks associated with chelation 
compared to its efficacy as a treatment for autism, it is advisable to first establish a definitive causal link between heavy metals and autism. This approach emphasizes the need to first validate the relationship between heavy metal exposure and autism before further studying on chelation as a treatment.

Therefore, it is crucial for anyone, whether medical professionals or families, considering chelation therapy to conduct a thorough baseline assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the treatment before proceeding with it. There is no medical organization that is in favor of using chelation therapy for autism.

# Stem Cell Therapy

::: {.callout-caution}
As of 2022, the use of stem cell therapy as a treatment or cure for autism is prohibited in India. This restriction has been implemented due to misleading promotions and false claims. The only way to legally and ethically access stem cell therapy is to participate in an approved clinical trial.

## What are stem cells?

Stem cells are a group of cells that are present in our bodies through all stages of life. In fact, they are one of the first cells developed during the embryo stage. These cells, under the right environment, have the ability to generate new stem cells and also other cells with specialized functions (blood cells, brain cells, bone cells etc.) Because of this unique feature, stem cells play a key role in the development of newborn children and also in the restorative processes after a disease or an injury. Their ability to self-renew and multiply, ensures an ongoing source of new cells to replace old or injured ones. During the developmental years, this growth is vital for maturing into an adult. Once development is complete, this ongoing growth aids in healing and repairing damaged tissues or organs at a cellular level. These special characteristics make stem cells highly important in regenerative medicine, as they can create entire tissues and organs from just a small group of precursor cells.This characteristic of stem cells has kindled research interest in trying this as a treatment for various diseases.

## What is stem cell therapy?

Stem cell therapy, also known as regenerative medicine, aids in fixing damaged, malfunctioning, or injured tissues using stem cells or their byproducts. It marks a new phase in organ transplantation, utilizing cells rather than donor organs that are limited.

In laboratories, scientists cultivate stem cells under favorable conditions. These cells are modified to become specific cell types, like heart muscle, blood, or nerve cells. These specialized cells can be placed into a person's body. For instance, if someone has a heart condition, these cells might be inserted into the heart muscle. The transplanted healthy heart muscle cells may assist in repairing the damaged heart muscle.

## History of stem cell therapy

Zoologists Theodor Heinrich Boveri and Valentin Häcker used the term stem cell to describe cells committed to give rise to the germline. 

+ 1950s - scientists studied the potential of stem cells majorly through bone marrow and its role in generating various blood cells

+ 1956 - first successful bone marrow transplant was done. This procedure laid the foundation for using stem cells in medical treatments, especially in treating diseases like leukemia and other blood-related disorders.

+ 1981 - mouse embryonic stem cells was first cultured in the laboratory

+ 1988 - first umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant took place in a child with Fancoi’s anemia.

+ 1998 - scientists isolated and cultured human embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough enabled researchers to work with cells that had the potential to develop into almost any cell type in the human body. This discovery opened up new possibilities for regenerative medicine and treatment of a wide array of diseases and injuries.

+ 2006 - Discovered the technique of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), which involves transforming adult skin cells into cells that closely mimic human embryonic stem cells

+ Presently, stem cell therapy is applied in various areas of medicine. For example, bone marrow transplants are used in the treatment of leukemia and other blood disorders. Stem cells are being researched and utilized for regenerative medicine to potentially treat conditions such as heart disease, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and more. Clinical trials and research studies continue to explore the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for various health conditions.

## Why was it tried for autism?

Stem cell therapy has been considered as a potential treatment for autism due to the belief that it might target certain biological mechanisms or symptoms (immune system regulation and inflammation, neural connectivity, etc.)  associated with the condition. 

Reasons why stem cell therapy is being explored for autism include:

+ Regenerative Potential: Stem cells possess the capability to transform into various cell types. The idea is that they might aid in repairing or regenerating damaged or dysfunctional cells in the brain or nervous system, potentially impacting autism-related symptoms.

+ Inflammation and Immune Modulation: Studies suggest that immune system dysregulation or inflammation might contribute to certain cases of autism. Some types of stem cells, particularly mesenchymal stem cells, have shown potential in regulating immune responses and reducing inflammation. Researchers hope that this immune-modulating ability might alleviate certain autism-related symptoms.

+ Neuroprotective and Neurotrophic Effects: Stem cells produce substances that support the growth and survival of neurons. Researchers explore whether stem cells could protect existing neurons, encourage neuronal growth, and potentially enhance neural connections in individuals with autism.

+ Experimental Nature of Treatment: While conventional treatments for autism primarily focus on behavioral and therapeutic interventions, stem cell therapy is considered experimental. It aims to address potential underlying biological factors that traditional therapies might not directly target.

However, it's essential to understand that while stem cell therapy has shown promise in various medical areas, its effectiveness and safety in treating autism are still being investigated. Clinical trials exploring the safety and potential efficacy of stem cell therapy for autism began in the early 2010s. These trials aimed to investigate the safety, feasibility, and any potential improvements in behavior, communication, and other symptoms associated with autism. It remains an experimental and unproven treatment for autism. 

The scientific and medical community stress the necessity for further comprehensive research, including well-designed clinical trials, to determine its safety, efficacy, and long-term impact on individuals with autism.

## Caution

Stem cell therapy for Autism is still under investigation and there is no established finding of cure in using the treatment for autism. There are limited studies and no definitive results yet. Among the limited studies, the results cannot be generalized as all of the studies have a small sample size. Like any medical intervention, stem cell therapy also carries potential risks. 


+ Unintended side effects or complications could arise from the procedure, such as infection, immune rejection, or the formation of tumors.

+ The outcomes of stem cell therapy for autism can vary widely from person to person. It's difficult to predict how an individual will respond to the treatment or if it will have any positive effects on their symptoms.

+ It involves invasive medical procedures and requires the individual to be admitted for at least 5 days. Furthermore, the treatment is hard on the pocket when done commercially.

+ Some facilities offering stem cell treatments might not adhere to strict regulatory standards or might lack sufficient scientific evidence supporting their procedures. If any medical center is experimenting and an individual is part of a clinical trial, they should be treated free of cost.

+ There have been reports of adverse short-term effects associated with stem cell therapy, including aggressive behavior, nausea, vomiting, and seizures. Research on the long-term effects of stem cell therapy is still in its early stages, and a comprehensive understanding of its lasting impact is yet to be established. 

## Current status in India

Starting around 2010, stem cell therapy has been advertised as a potential cure for autism by many practitioners in India, despite no evidence for the same. Many parents have fallen victim to the unethical medical and business practice associated with stem cell treatment. 

As of 2022, the use of stem cell therapy as a treatment or cure for autism is prohibited in India. This restriction has been implemented due to misleading promotions and false claims. 
Currently, stem cell therapy for conditions outlined in the National Guideline for Stem Cell Research (NGSCR) 2017, excluding Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)/ hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), is neither accessible nor permitted. Individuals can only participate in stem cell treatment through a clinical trial if they meet the specified criteria for the trial.

In this context, it's important to highlight that there is currently no clinical evidence validating the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treating autism. Therefore, any facility claiming otherwise should be approached with caution and careful consideration. The National Medical Council (NMC) calls it professional misconduct when anybody practices, advertises, or promotes stem cell therapy as a treatment or cure for autism.

Given these factors, families considering stem cell therapy believing it will lead to significant improvements or a cure for autism need to seriously reconsider and make an informed decision. The only ethical and scientific way to get stem cell therapy is to participate in a well designed clinical trial or study. The path ahead demands a cautious approach to verify the safety, efficacy and long term impacts of the therapy.
