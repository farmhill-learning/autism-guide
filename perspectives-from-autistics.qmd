## Video - Unmasking the Stigma Behind Autism in Females | Emmy Peach | TEDxUGA

Emmy Peach, who got diagnosed at the age of 19 shares that even though her brother was diagnosed when he was 2, she was not because traditional diagnostic criterias are based on male presentations of autism. She adds that girls also learn to mask at a younger age which becomes more difficult to get help. 

She talks about the impact of being diagnosed and the persistent stigma around autism. She encourages unmasking, embracing neurodiversity, and being authentic.
