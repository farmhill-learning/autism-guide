      "content": "Eating Interventions Children and Eating Battles around food are an unavoidable part of being a parent. Children and parents seem to have completely different opinions about pretty much every aspect of food - what to eat, when to eat and how to eat. Eating more than what we need, ‘indulging’, seems to be becoming a cultural norm. It does not help that more and more junk food is being engineered to create cravings. “No one can eat just one” is not a cute advertisement tagline any more, it is starting to sound more and more like a warning on an addictive substance! At the same time, issues like picky eating, eating in a hurry, refusing to chew, not being able to maintain oral hygiene are on the rise. These issues become much more pronounced and difficult to handle with neurodiverse children, whose sensitivities and anxieties are as such difficult to live with. As parents, our goal should be to help children eat good food in reasonable quantities at a sustained pace. In this article, we present a few thoughts and hands-on techniques to help neurodiverse children acquire and maintain good food habits. Cultivate a good attitude towards food For many parents, food is synonymous with love. We can never hold back our love or their favourite food! Most of our children love food, they are fully attentive and engaged around it, and it is difficult to think how that love is impacting them. However, our love should empower them, make them healthy and independent. Eating is a part of lifestyle. Also, modelling is very powerful. So, any change we expect in the food habits of the child has to be implemented by the entire family. The family should have a good routine for waking up and getting physical activity in the morning. It is important to drink water to stimulate bowel movement and build a sense of hunger. This is especially important for pooreaters. It is important to plan balanced meals. Have a weekly meeting to plan the menu. Make space for favourite foods like samosas, popcorn or chicken burgers. Decide on the quantities. Even if your child is not verbal, make them a part of the meeting and let them respond with yes or no. All this activity builds predictability and reduces anxiety about favourite foods. You can use the menu as an opportunity to build communication, create a sense of time through the calendar, build it into their weekly #schedule, help them get into the habit of checking written instructions or schedules instead of asking the same questions again and again…the possibilities are endless! Remember our children love food and it is a great motivator. Last but not least, eat together as a family as frequently as you can. Show how to eat measured quantities of food. Talk about food and how you enjoy good food. Model to children that one can eat good, healthy food in moderate quantities and still be happy!",

      "content": "This is by far the most common issue with neurodiverse children, especially as they grow up. Children eat because food calms them down, it provides actual psychological comfort! Most neurodiverse children also do not have well developed interoception that tells them when they are full. Sometimes, food not being available makes them upset and aggressive. While food calms them down, overeating affects health negatively. It is necessary to address this. Food and eating is a lifestyle issue. The entire family has to follow, model and reinforce the behaviour we expect of them. Working together and supporting each other is important. 1. Make a weekly menu plan together. Include favourite as well as not favourite foods. The menu gives visibility of when favourite food is scheduled and helps prepare oneself for the not so favourite food. Remember to accommodate fancy food items and some junk food so there is no sense of deprivation. 2. The menu should cover all meals - midmorning snack, evening tea etc. If it is not on the menu, you do not eat it. 3. Agree on measurements - we will have one samosa each; or one bowl of popcorn. Do not prepare or buy more than that. 4. On a daily basis, for every meal, everyone gets into the habit of measuring and eating - two rotis, one bowl of biryani etc. This shows them that everyone is following the same rules. 5. Remember it is okay to say - “you have eaten your share. We can have this again - in the evening/tomorrow/next week” - as per your menu. Talk together, plan, do it together - modelling is very important. Take help of your therapists to handle any behaviours around food. Also, start when the children are young, it helps them get into good routines and helps everyone!",

      "resource_key": "resource-eating",
      "content": "Some neurodiverse children eat very little food. It becomes a medical concern as the child’s immunity becomes low, they fall ill frequently, cannot play or move as they want to or like to, get irritated quickly which results in overall unhappiness and many behavioural issues. An unhappy child finds it difficult to learn or relate positively to learning. Again, let us remember that eating is a lifestyle issue. While there are specific interventions to help with eating too little, interventions work well when the right environment and attitudes are in place. It is important for the entire family to follow, model and reinforce the behaviour we expect of the children. Working together and supporting each other is important. However, please eliminate any medical issues like dental sensitivities, stomach ailments etc. before trying the following interventions. Also, address any sensory sensitivities. Setting up the environment and attitude The family should have a good routine for waking up and getting physical activity in the morning. It is important to drink water to stimulate bowel movement and build a sense of hunger. This is especially important for #pooreaters. Having access to food throughout the day does not help with building an appetite. Food should be available at fixed time intervals that are part of a schedule. Even if a child ate poorly at breakfast, giving them a large glass of milk as a mid-morning snack may not be a good idea, as it interferes with the next meal. Relying on children’s hunger and letting them starve if they do not eat also does not help build good eating habits. Again, most neurodiverse children have poor interoception - they may not understand the relationship between eating, feeling full and that satisfaction leading to good quality time. If we let them starve, they may end up getting accustomed to staying hungry. Reading books about food, learning about different kinds of food and tastes, communicating ‘I like’ and ‘I don’t like’ for foods, cooking and baking, talking about feelings while having these conversations can help in building food positivity in children. Here is a video sample of a social story about a boy eating lunch, that can help a child get comfortable around eating. {{}} All members of the family eating together as frequently as you can is important. While you eat together, talk about food and how you enjoy good food. Model to children that one can safely try new food, it is okay to try and that sometimes you may end up liking new food too! Intervention for quantity 1. Notice how much food the child is able to eat, at the beginning. This is the baseline for how much the child needs to eat. Measure this in spoonfuls, bites or mouthfuls. 2. Make a visual schedule for the previously decided measure and the child ticks each box as they finish each measure. We can also use tokens that the child can remove for the countdown. This helps the child track how much they have eaten and how much more is left. Predictability helps manage anxiety. Here is a video that shows a child using tokens to eat a minimum quantity. {{}} 3. Once the child gets comfortable eating that portion for a few days, gradually increase the measure over a number of days. Decide the pace of increment carefully so we do not overwhelm the child with suddenly increasing demands. 4. Clearly inform the child whenever demand is increased. 5. With some children, preparing them with a social story helps. Writing a menu together and discussions about food also help the child to prepare himself to eat. Increasing variety Once the child becomes comfortable with the schedule of eating, introduce one new food every three days, just one spoonful - preparing by writing a schedule and social story. Slowly, new foods became staple foods.",

      "content": "The other common issue with neurodiverse children is that they eat either too fast or too slow. Some finish an entire meal in 5 minutes; some take up to 2 hours to eat a snack. Typically, in either case, the child does not chew properly and it affects digestion. The quick eaters usually eat quite a lot of food before their hunger and palate are satisfied. This leads to weight gain and associated negative loops. The slow eaters tend to pocket the food in the mouth - this affects their oral hygiene. Also, the food tastes bland after being in the mouth for a long time and they lose interest. Intervention for the quick eaters The key is to create some delay between one mouthful and the next, encouraging them to eat slowly and chew properly. 1. the child has a smiley chart and a bowl of smileys. The chart is a laminated sheet with velcro afixed on it. Smileys also have velcro fixed at the back. Pictures are below. {fig-align=\"center\"} {fig-align=\"center\"} 2. Once the child takes one spoonful of food into the mouth, they fix the smileys from the bowl, on the chart. During this time, they keep chewing and the rule is they cannot take another mouthful till all the smileys are fixed. The chart with all smileys fixed looks like this. {fig-align=\"center\"} 3. Once all smileys are fixed, they take another spoonful of food. 4. This time, they pick the smileys from the chart and put them in the bowl. 5. Keep doing this till the food is finished. Here is a video showing a child using a smiley chart to maintain a delay between mouthfuls. {{}} Once, we came across a child who would touch food and everything around with both hands. Smiley chart would have been unhygienic. We modified the intervention. 1. A table mat, with spaces drawn for the child’s plate, glass and hands was created. The child was expected to keep the plate and glass on the mat, as well as keep their hands on the spaces indicated on the mat. The mat can look like this. {fig-align=\"center\"} 2. A number line with numbers 1 to 10 was also drawn on the top of the mat. 3. The child takes a spoonful of food, and uses fingers to count from one to ten on the numberline. They chew while doing this. 4. Once the numbers are counted, they can take the next spoonful. 5. The mat structure helped the child keep their hands clean while eating, as well as introducing delay between spoonfuls through counting. Here is a video showing a child using a mat like that to maintain a healthy pace of eating. {{}} In both the above cases, the children were older than ten. All the prompts used to remind them to follow the sequence were either written or pictorial so there was not much verbal input, repeated instructions or anyone losing temper. Intervention for the slow eaters With slow eaters, the key is to create a limit on the time the child keeps food in the mouth. To do this, we mark the beginning and ending of each mouthful so the child has a cue for when the food should be swallowed. We also need to help the child keep track of how much they should eat and how much they have eaten. For this, we use checkboxes or tokens. 1. Establish the average quantity the child can comfortably eat. Measure this in bites, spoonfuls or mouthfuls. 2. Make a visual schedule for the number of measures to be eaten. We provide tick boxes or tokens for each measure. For example, if the child has to eat 15 spoonfuls, we make 15 checkboxes or give 15 tokens. 3. The child takes food in the mouth. We start counting from 1 to 10, in a calm voice, to encourage the child to continue chewing. We can also draw a number line and progress on it if we want to avoid verbal input. This tells the child that they have to finish the mouthful within this count. 4. At the end of the count, the child ticks a box or counts down by removing a token. 5. We can plan a break for every 3 or 5 measures, so the child can pause and does not get overwhelmed. 6. The intervention ends when the food is finished!",

      "content": "Resource: Building Independence Supporting Executive Function and Independence through schedules Executive functioning includes skills such as planning, organizing, and carrying out tasks to completion. Many autistic and ADHD individuals experience unique challenges in these areas, which often means they need support from caregivers or family members during everyday routines. Understanding the Cycle of Dependence{.unnumbered} When executive functioning is not well established in an individual, it’s natural for caregivers to step in with lots of help, instructions, and reminders. As a result: - Children may begin relying heavily on caregivers for “what to do next,” even when they actually know the answer. - Caregivers can unintentionally set a pattern where their child waits for instructions or approval before acting. - This cycle makes it harder for children and young people to build confidence in making their own choices or completing tasks on their own. Example routines affected: - Brushing teeth - Eating meals - Completing homework or learning activities - Engaging in relaxing activities like drawing or listening to music How This Affects the Whole Family{.unnumbered} Over time, both the child and caregiver can become overwhelmed: - Parents/caregivers feel exhausted by constantly giving instructions and worrying about the next step. - Children may feel demotivated and lose interest in tasks, sometimes refusing to participate at all. - Both may experience emotional outbursts, increased rigidity, and frustration, impacting their connection and the enjoyment of daily life. Putting Agency in the Hands of Autistic and ADHD Individuals{.unnumbered} Fostering agency means supporting individuals with autism and ADHD to make choices and lead parts of their routines. Key steps include: - Creating a shared workspace: A safe, collaborative space where the autistic or ADHD individual and their caregiver can work together to set goals and decide how to approach tasks. - Making independence a goal: Gradually shifting the focus from caregiver-led to self-led routines, even if small steps are needed. - Encouraging decision-making: Allowing individuals to choose how and when to complete certain activities or tackle challenges. - Using visual supports and schedules: Tools like checklists or picture guides can reduce reliance on verbal instructions and boost independence. Tips for Families and Caregivers{.unnumbered} - Be patient and flexible—progress toward independence can take time. - Break tasks into small, achievable steps, celebrating each success. - Provide choices whenever possible, so the individual feels ownership over tasks. - Use consistent routines with clear expectations, but allow for flexibility as skills grow. - Notice and reduce “prompt dependency”—pause before stepping in, giving the individual a chance to try on their own. Building Towards Independence{.unnumbered} The journey toward greater independence is unique for every individual. By sharing responsibility, setting mutual goals, and trusting the capabilities of people with autism or ADHD, families can create a more positive, less stressful experience for everyone.",

      "content": "Understanding Schedules{.unnumbered} A schedule is a structured list of events or activities, laid out in a way that fits the person using it. Schedules can be visual, written, or digital, and are especially supportive for autistic and neurodivergent individuals. A schedule is not something imposed—it's a shared tool that respects agency, adapts to preferences, and grows with the individual. Why Use a Schedule?{.unnumbered} Schedules are more than just plans; they're companions for the day. They: - Organize your day, giving a sense of what’s coming next. - Create calm by reducing surprises. - Reduce overwhelm and anxiety, especially when the world feels unpredictable. A truly helpful schedule is personal and meaningful. It isn’t just followed—it belongs to the person who uses it. Any change should be discussed together. How Schedules Foster Agency Getting Started{.unnumbered} - At first, a caregiver may plan the schedule. - The goal is collaboration: plan with the person using the schedule, not only for them. - Refer to examples like the 'Managing children at home' guide for varied age groups. Helping with Choices{.unnumbered} - Agency starts with choosing. - Offer visuals of activities (e.g., two pictures), let the person pick what to add. - If someone is distressed, offer a choice: \"Do you want this activity?\" If the answer is \"No,\" gently ask or present another option. - Use yes/no questions and let the person’s voice lead the process. - Some children tend to choose the same activity repeatedly. This is okay initially, as it builds comfort with the choice-making process. Gradually introduce new options alongside familiar ones to expand their preferences over time. The related schedule can look like this. !Choice Schedule Here is a video that demonstrates how to help a child choose between two activities. {{}} Here is another video that shows how to offer choices using yes and no questions. {{}} Growing Independence as a Skill{.unnumbered} Independence is learned over time. It's not an abstract value—it's a skill you develop, with support. Within an Activity - To become independent in an activity: - Know the steps. - Have the skills to do each step. - Use visual cues or transitions to move between steps. Within a Schedule - For independent use of a schedule: - Understand how to transition between activities. - Identify the next activity and gather the right items. - Signal for help when needed. Over a Day - To manage an entire day: - Recognize the day's activities. - Adjust for what’s planned each day (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends). - Manage time as well as tasks. Owning the Whole Process - For full independence: - Set personal goals. - Break down big tasks into manageable steps over several days. - Track progress, add breaks and self-care, and balance both short-term needs and long-term hopes. What a Schedule Does (And Doesn’t Do) - A schedule says what to do, not how to do it. - Skills for each activity need to be taught and practiced separately. Practical Uses of Schedules{.unnumbered} Schedules can support: - Daily routines from wake-up to bedtime (full-day schedules). - Specific periods (partial schedules). - Repeating favorite activities. - Waiting for turn or favorite activities. - Easing into activities that are harder to start. - Handling anxiety about new or non-preferred tasks. - Completing every step in multi-step routines (like morning or night routines). Functional Benefits{.unnumbered} - Gives visibility: See what comes next in the day. - Supports transitions: Clear beginnings and endings make change easier. - Helps with priming: Knowing when a less-favorite activity is coming makes it more manageable. - Reduces repetitive questioning: Reliance shifts from checking with a caregiver to checking the schedule, fostering independence. - Builds executive functioning: Practicing planning, organizing, and carrying out tasks. Here is a video that shows how a visual schedule to walk a child through a set of activities and transitions. {{}}",

Inform the person about the change (don't surprise them, unless it's urgent). 2. Make the change together—update the schedule in front of them. 3. Pause when upset; use emotion charts or yes/no questions to discuss feelings and new choices. 4. Offer alternatives: Let the person pick what comes next. 5.

Scheduling and sticking to the schedule are difficult even with adults. A schedule demands accountability, responsibility and consistency from the parent/facilitator. If the person holding it together is not organised, schedules are likely to cause more distress and disharmony. This is likely to foster sense of failure and lead to procrastination at pathological levels. The most common reasons for scheuduling \"not working\" are: - Putting an activity in the schedule and not doing it. One needs to ensure to plan such that the child learns to think about schedule as essential to be followed. - Making changes to the schedule however we want. Any changes can be made only after informing the child. Even then, it is ideal to reason why it is being done. - Doing some activities and leaving some activities. - Doing on some days and not doing on some days. - Bringing in schedule only when there are challenging behaviors. Then the autistic person feels its a punishment for their bad behavior resulting in resentment towards schedule. Without a Schedule The alternative is rarely easier. Not having a schedule can mean: - More corrections and redirections. - Less predictability. - Difficulty starting or completing activities. - Disordered routines, like snacking or screen time at odd hours. - More emotional dysregulation (for everyone). A schedule offers direction, agency, and calm. Final Thoughts Schedules are not just tools—they’re bridges to agency, independence, and calmer days. They can be as flexible and creative as needed, always centered around the neurodivergent person’s right to choice, respect, and joyful participation in life. When agency is shared and supported, daily living skills become more manageable, motivation increases, and the bond between caregiver and child grows stronger. Please note that these interventions are shared for general guidance. Designing and executing interventions - more importantly - noticing how the child responds and modifying the interventions so the child does not get distressed, is a specialist job. Consult qualified therapists as necessary.*",

      "content": "Money - where it comes from and where we use it Children are exposed to money very young. They see it getting exchanged for almost everything from morning to evening. Money has been part of functional math for many decades and lots of activities have been identified and written about. Then the question of why we are writing one more version again. When we try to teach money to autistic children, it quickly boils down to basic operations of mathematics. Then we see that the progress stagnates as the activities lose their novelty with the students. The consistency of answers reduces as the interest wanes off. We realised that the same happens with neurotypical children too. However, when the Neurotypical children start to interact with the world, they learn exactly how money works, how easy or difficult it is to have money with us and who to ask, where to spend etc. The children keep their relationship with money active throughout their lives as adults as well. They become earning members and then think about saving for their family and future. On the other hand, neurodivergent children get exposure to money only in the form of a small grocery or milk store at the corner of the street, some may even have a budget to spend on clothes and other things. The other aspects of money are not talked about. Most autistic children know money as a medium to get things, but when it comes to other uses of money, their knowledge may not be complete as they do not handle money. Many neurodivergent adults struggle with relationships with work, being reliable, accountable, feedback, conflict between wants and needs and how to make smart decisions around money to be able to do what one wants to do in life. Rather than learning money as something to do about basic mathematical operations, it is important to make a case for why one should learn about money. That is why when we introduce money as a learning concept, it stays popular until we play shop game or a restaurant game. It is challenging to take it forward from there and make sense to the autistic learner. About this lesson plan This lesson is designed for primary or early middle school learners and aims to help children understand what money is, where it comes from, how it is used, and why it is important. The session can run for 60–75 minutes, or be split into two shorter lessons if needed. The purpose is to take students from their existing ideas about money and guide them through a clear understanding of work, earning, saving, spending, and differentiating between goods and services. Lesson Objectives By the end of the lesson, children should be able to: - Identify things for which we need money - Recognize people who typically have money and why - Explain where money comes from (earning through work) - Understand how we spend money at different places - Understand that we buy things and well as pay some people",

Introduction – Activating Prior Knowledge (5–10 min) The lesson begins with an introduction to activate prior knowledge.

These ideas are noted down to help anchor the discussion. - Start with a warmup question: “What do we do with money?” - Let students list things they can buy with money (food, water, tickets, clothes, groceries). - Record answers on the board. Give the heading ‘What we get from money?’ or just say ‘What?’ Who Has Money? (5–10 min) From there, the conversation moves to “Who has money?” Students are encouraged to identify that most adults have money and that adults earn it through work, rather than receiving it for free or from nowhere. - Prompt: “Who has money?” - Guide them toward understanding that most adults have money. - Ask, \"Where does your mommy/daddy get money from?\" → Lead them to the idea of working to earn. - Make a heading on the board, next to ‘What’ - The heading can say ‘Who has the money?’ Where Does Money Come From? (10 min) Children are then guided to think critically about where money comes from. Misconceptions like “money grows on trees” are addressed playfully but clearly, explaining that money is earned by working and often stored in banks or post offices for safety. The teacher asks follow-up questions such as “Who puts money in the bank?” to help students recognise the link between people working, earning, and depositing money before they can withdraw it ater. - Address misconceptions: money does not come from trees or appear \"from nowhere\". - Give a heading on the board next to ‘Who’ - It can say ‘Where does money come from?’. Notedown the children’s answers. They could be ATM s, Banks, Post offices, wallets, Appa/Amma, basically anything. - Once listing down responses is done, examine each response. For examples, wallet or bank was the response. Then a follow up question could be, ‘Who put money in the wallet? “How does money reach the bank?” - Explain banks and post offices as places to keep money. Wallet is where we carry our money. We can then ask, ‘what does your mother/father do? Do they go to office? What do they do there? Do they get money?’ (Choose only the parent who earns money. We will introduce ‘unpaid work’ as a separate idea’ in the future). Transition: “So, to have money, what must we do?” → Work. - How can you get money? - Does your teacher get money? - Does your cook get money? - Choose more questions from the children’s context. - Make a list of people they know, the work they do and note if they get money or not. - Conclude with people get money when they work. Worksheets Worksheets below can be used to reinforce concepts discussed in the class. {{}} Activity 2 - Reading a graphic book and role play This graphic book presents a a step-by-step story of Ishita’s hospital visit. Students learn that getting medicine when sick includes several steps where money is needed: paying for transport to the hospital (petrol, taxi fare), paying the doctor’s consultation fees, and then paying at the pharmacy for medicines. In the next part, this example is acted out through role-play, with some children taking the roles of patient, driver, doctor, and pharmacist. The activity reinforces that navigating even one situation can involve many different goods and services that all cost money. Warm-Up (2–3 minutes) Quick recall of Part 1 lesson: - What do we do with money? - Who has money? - Where does money come from? Transition: “Let’s see how one person uses money in a single day when they go to the hospital.” Read the following story of Ishita to children. {{}} Discussion Note the responses on the board as you ask questions about the entire scenario. - How was Ishita feeling? - What did she do when she felt sick? - Where did she go first? - What did she do at the petrol bunk? - How much did she pay? - Where did she go next? - Who asked her to pay money at the hospital? - How much did she pay? - Where did she go next? - How much did she pay for the medicines? Let us summarise how she spent money. - Petrol - Rs. 500 - Hospital - Rs.200 - Medicines - Rs.250. - How much did she spend in total? (Let children respond using either their books or calculator. - What are the things she bought? (Petrol and medicines) - Did she buy anything at the hospital? - Why did she give money to the receptionist? (To see the doctor) - Which person saw her only when she paid the money? (Doctor) Conclude Travel to hospital (needs petrol → needs money) Doctor visit (consultation fee → needs money) Buy medicines at pharmacy (needs money) So, we pay money - to buy things - to some people when they help us. Worksheets You can use the following worksheets for story recall and reinforcing the concepts discussed in the class. {{}} Role Play of Ishita's Hospital Visit Ishita visiting a hospital can also be done as a role play to make it more interesting for children. This can be a follow up activity after reading the story. This is the lesson plan for role play. You can download the entire lesson plan below. {{}} Time: 10–15 minutes Objective To help students understand that in daily life, money is needed at multiple stages—things we buy and people’s work/help. Warm-Up (2–3 minutes) Quick recall of Part 1 lesson: - What do we do with money? - Who has money? - Where does money come from? Transition: “Let’s see how one person uses money in a single day when they go to the hospital.” Assign Roles (2 minutes) Select 5–6 students to play: - Ishita (the patient) - Petrol pump attendant - Receptionist at hospital - Doctor - Pharmacist (medical shop person) (If class is big, you can add extras like driver, nurse, cashier who collects money, etc.) Materials to keep ready - Make play money with paper chits written as 500, 200, 200 and 50 Rupees to be used by Ishita to make payments at various places. - A wallet for Ishita to keep the money in - A clip board with paper and pen at the hospital reception - A prescription pad for the doctor. It can be a small notebook or a paper which is pre written. - A bill book for medical shop attendant to write the bill. The bill could be prewritten. - Medicines in one brown colour paper coveer to give to Ishita Role-Play Script (5–7 minutes) Teacher narrates while students act. Scene 1: Ishita falls sick Ishita: “I am sick, I need to see a doctor.” Scene 2: Petrol Pump Ishita (pretends to drive): “Oh! I need to fill petrol.” Petrol pump attendant: “How much petrol should I fill?” Ishita: “Fill for 500 rupees.” Attendant pretends to fill → Ishita hands play money. Scene 3: Hospital Reception Receptionist: “Please register and pay 200 rupees consultation fee.” Ishita pretends to fill form and pays ₹200. Scene 4: Doctor’s Visit Doctor (examines): “You have an infection. Please take these medicines.” Ishita: “Thank you, doctor!” Scene 5: Pharmacy Ishita: “Please give me these medicines.” (hands prescription) Pharmacist: “Here are your medicines. Please pay 250 rupees.” Ishita pays and collects medicines. Class Discussion (5 minutes) Guiding Questions: - How was Ishita feeling? - What did she do when she felt sick? - Where did she go first? How much did she pay at the petrol bunk? - Who asked her to pay at the hospital? Why? - How much did she pay for the medicines? On the Board – Write summary: - Petrol: ₹500 - Hospital fee: ₹200 - Medicines: ₹250 - Total = ₹950 Deeper Reflection: - What items did she buy? → Petrol, medicines. - What service did she pay for? → Doctor’s consultation. - Who only saw her after money was paid? → Doctor. Conclusion (1–2 minutes) Key Learning: We need money… ✅ To buy things (petrol, medicines) ✅ To pay for services (doctor, hospital staff) ✅ At many steps in a single activity like visiting the hospital 💡 Teacher wrap-up statement: “So you see, even in one small trip, Ishita had to spend money in many places. Money is needed for both things we buy and for people’s work.” ✏️ Teacher Tip for Younger Kids: Use play money, small props like a toy car, prescription slip, empty medicine box to make it fun. Activity 3 - Cooking Chicken Biryani This is a discussion activity where previously learnt concepts are reinforced using the example of cooking a dish - Chicken Biryani. The activity highlights how money is needed at multiple steps: buying ingredients from different shops and paying the cook for their work. A few worksheets are also presented. You can download the lesson plan below. {{}} Time: 15–20 min Objective To help children understand: - Money is needed to buy goods (ingredients). - Money is also used to pay people for their work (the cook). - Even for one dish, payments happen at many steps/places. Warm-up (2–3 min) Quick talk: “What do we do with money?” (buy things, pay people) Transition: “Let’s see how money is used when we prepare food at home.” List Ingredients (3–4 min) Ask: “What ingredients do we need for chicken biryani?” Teacher writes on board: Chicken 🍗 Vegetables 🥕🥔 Spices 🌶️ Oil/Ghee 🧈 Basmati rice 🍚 Saffron 🌸 Where to Buy? (3–4 min) Beside each ingredient, the class identifies where it is bought: Chicken → 🏪 Meat shop Vegetables → 🥬 Vegetable market Spices, Rice, Oil, Saffron → 🛒 Supermarket / Grocery Reinforce: “Do we get it without paying?” → No. We must pay money. The Cook’s Role (2–3 min) Discuss: “Now that we have the ingredients, who will cook the biryani?” Children: “Cook!” 👩‍🍳 Teacher: “Cooking is the cook’s work. The cook also gets paid money for work.” Vertical Flow Chart (make on board / worksheet) Vegetables → Vegetable Shop → Pay Money Spices/Rice/Oil → Supermarket → Pay Money Meat (Chicken) → Meat Shop → Pay Money Cook makes Biryani → Cook works for us → Pay Money Class Discussion (5 minutes) Ask Questions: - Which things did we buy with money? - Which person did we pay for doing work? (Cook) - Why could we not take ingredients without paying? - Can we eat biryani without ingredients? (No → need money to get them) Concluding Message: ✨ We pay money to buy things. ✨ We also pay money to people when they work. ✨ Even for one dish, many payments happen in different places. ✅ Activity Outcomes for Children By the end of this session, children will: Identify common goods we pay for (vegetables, chicken, rice, spices). Understand people’s work (cook, shopkeepers) also requires money. See that food on our table involves money many times over. ⚡ Teacher Tip: You can turn this into a role-play version too: one child is the parent, others are shopkeepers (vegetable seller, meat seller, supermarket cashier), and one is the cook. Use pretend play (tokens/coins, picture cards of chicken/veggies) to make it real. Consolidation(5 min) Students answer the following questions. And then do a worksheet. If you choose to do the two activities on different days, the consolidation questions can be asked after each activity listed above. This will help with reinforcing the basic ideas. If the lesson plan is being done in three days, then it is important to do introductory activities of what, who, where and then do the activities each day. What do we need money for? We need money to buy things and pay people when they help us How can we get money? We get money by working. Who has the money? Most adults have money because they work. When do we use money or pay money? to buy things and pay people when people work for us Worksheets Use the following worksheets to reinforce the concepts covered in this activity. {{}}",

These behaviors or interests set ASD apart from conditions defined by problems with social communication and interaction only. Examples of restricted or repetitive behaviors and interests related to ASD can include: + Lines up toys or other objects and gets upset when order is changed + Plays with toys the same way every time + Is focused on parts of objects (for example, wheels) + Gets upset by minor changes + Has obsessive interests + Must follow certain routines + Flaps hands, rocks body, or spins self in circles + Has unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel + Fussy eating habits + Lack of coordination, clumsiness + Impulsiveness (acting without thinking) + Aggressive behavior, both with self and others + Short attention span Other Characteristics Most people with ASD have other related characteristics. These might include + Delayed movement skills + Delayed cognitive or learning skills + Hyperactive, impulsive, and/or inattentive behavior + Epilepsy or seizure disorder + Unusual eating and sleeping habits + Gastrointestinal issues (for example, constipation) + Unusual mood or emotional reactions + Anxiety, stress, or excessive worry + Lack of fear or more fear than expected When any of these signs are observed, it is advisable to recommend that the family consult with a developmental pediatrician who can conduct more extensive screening and assessments.",

      "content": "Screening tools are assessments that identify at risk children. Children who are found to be at risk with the screening tool, should go for further assessments. Screening tool commonly used by clinical/ developmental psychologists and psychiatrists in India is M-CHAT-R/F (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up) The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F; Robins, Fein, & Barton, 2009) is a two-stage parent-report screening tool designed to assess the risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The M-CHAT-R/F is freely available for download for clinical, research, and educational purposes. Here are the usage instructions: + The M-CHAT-R can be utilized and scored during routine well-child care visits, and it is also suitable for specialists and other professionals to evaluate the risk of ASD. + The primary objective of the M-CHAT-R is to maximize sensitivity, meaning it aims to identify as many cases of ASD as possible. Consequently, there is a relatively high rate of false positives, indicating that not all children who score as at risk will be diagnosed with ASD. + To address this, the Follow-Up questions (M-CHAT-R/F) have been developed. Users should be aware that even with the Follow-Up questions, a significant number of children who screen positive on the M-CHAT-R will not receive an ASD diagnosis. However, it's important to recognize that these children are at a heightened risk for other developmental disorders or delays, making it crucial to consider further evaluation for any child who screens positive. Occupational Therapy Evaluation As an occupational therapist (OT), the evaluation of a child with autism involves a comprehensive assessment of various domains, including social, communication, cognitive, sensory, and motor skills. It is valuable to incorporate a sensory profile of the child and consider the results of assessments conducted by other professionals. The Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) assessment conducted by an occupational therapist can take place in diverse settings, such as at home, in school, or at one of our clinics. During the ASD assessment, the occupational therapist, using their clinical expertise and specialized training, employs a combination of a sensory profile, autism checklist and clinical observation. The checklist and sensory profile is designed to gather information on how the child perceives and interacts with the world. For example, it includes questions related to the child's comfort level in social situations, their preference for solitary play versus engaging with others, and other factors that provide insights into their sensory experiences and responses. This multidimensional assessment approach helps tailor intervention strategies to meet the child's specific needs and challenges. Speech and Language Evaluation As a Speech Language pathologist (SLP), one can conduct initial screenings to identify any communication and language delays or atypical behaviors that may be indicative of autism. SLPs can conduct comprehensive assessments to evaluate a child's communication and language skills. This assessment may involve evaluating speech and language development, as well as social communication abilities. Diagnostic tools It's important to emphasize that while SLPs and OTs are experts in the area of communication and functional skills respectively, they do not have the authority to diagnose autism. The formal diagnosis of autism is typically made by a medical professional, clinical psychologist, or developmental pediatrician based on a comprehensive evaluation that considers various factors, including communication and language development, social interactions, and repetitive behaviors. CARS - Childhood Rating Scale The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) has been updated as the CARS-2. The original CARS was a widely-used rating scale for autism, primarily designed for individuals with co-occurring intellectual functioning. However, it faced criticism for not accurately identifying higher-functioning individuals on the autism spectrum. The CARS-2 preserves the original CARS format for use with younger or lower-functioning individuals (now known as the CARS2-ST or \"Standard Form\"). Simultaneously, it introduces a distinct rating scale designed for higher-functioning individuals (referred to as the CARS2-HF or \"High Functioning\"). Clinically, the original CARS was sometimes misused as a parent questionnaire, but it was originally intended as a clinician rating scale to be completed following direct observation of the child by a professional knowledgeable about autism, who had also received some brief training on how to assess the CARS items. The CARS-2 maintains this format. Parent input can be gathered using the CARS2-QPC (Questionnaire of Parent Concerns), a form that parents use to document their observations (although it is not scored). Specific guidelines for usage include: + CARS2-ST can be employed with children under the age of 6, or over the age of 6 but with an estimated IQ of 79 or lower, or if there is a significant communication impairment. + CARS-HF is administered to children aged 6 or older, with an estimated IQ of 80 or higher, and who possess fluent communication skills. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) - (ADOS; Lord, Rutter, DiLavore, Risi, 1999) The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is considered the 'gold standard' for assessing and diagnosing autism and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) in individuals of all ages, developmental stages, and language abilities. This semi-structured assessment is versatile and can be applied to evaluate individuals suspected of having autism, ranging from toddlers to adults, and encompassing those with a wide spectrum of language skills. The ADOS comprises four distinct modules, each of which can be administered in a relatively short timeframe of 35 to 40 minutes. The module selected for assessment depends on the individual's expressive language level and chronological age. Guided by the instructions in the manual, the appropriate module is chosen for each person. Module 1 is designed for children who do not consistently use phrase speech, Module 2 for those using phrase speech but not verbally fluent Module 3 for fluent children, and Module 4 for fluent adolescents and adults. It's worth noting that the ADOS does not specifically address nonverbal adolescents and adults within the autism spectrum. During the ADOS assessment, there's a 30- to 45-minute observation period that offers ample opportunities for a trained administrator to observe social and communication behaviors relevant to the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders. As the ADOS is conducted, observations are recorded and later coded to formulate a diagnosis. Cut-off scores are provided for both the broader diagnosis of PDD/atypical autism/autism spectrum and the more traditional, narrower concept of autism. By offering standardized materials and ratings, the ADOS provides an evaluation of autism spectrum disorders that remains independent of language capabilities. Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) - (ADI-R; Couteur, Lord, Rutter, 2003) The Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) is a structured interview employed for the purpose of diagnosing autism, planning treatment strategies, and distinguishing autism from other developmental disorders. Having been used in research studies for many years, this comprehensive interview is an invaluable tool for conducting a thorough assessment of individuals suspected of having autism or related autism spectrum disorders. The administration and scoring of the ADI-R typically take between 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. To administer the ADI-R, a skilled clinical interviewer engages in a structured dialogue with a parent or caretaker who possesses in-depth knowledge of the developmental history and current behaviors of the individual being assessed. This interview can be utilized for assessing both children and adults, provided their mental age is above 2 years and 0 months. The ADI-R consists of 93 items and focuses on three key functional domains: Language/Communication Reciprocal Social Interactions Restricted, Repetitive, and Stereotyped Behaviors and Interests Following highly standardized procedures, the interviewer records and codes the responses provided by the informant. The interview questions cover eight distinct content areas: + The subject's background, including family, educational history, previous diagnoses, and medication use. + An overview of the subject's behavior. + Early development and achievement of developmental milestones. + Language acquisition and potential loss of language or other skills. + Current functioning related to language and communication. + Social development and play. + Interests and behaviors. + Clinically relevant behaviors, such as aggression, self-injury, and possible epileptic features. Unlike tests, the ADI-R is an interview process that focuses on behaviors that are uncommon in individuals not affected by autism. As a result, it yields specific results rather than relying on scales or norms. These results can be used to support a diagnosis of autism or to determine the clinical needs of various groups in which a high prevalence of autism spectrum disorders might be expected. This includes individuals with severe language impairments, certain medical conditions, congenital blindness, or those who have experienced institutional deprivation.

      "content": "Absolutely, revealing an autism diagnosis to parents is a crucial and sensitive step in the process. It's essential for professionals to approach this conversation with empathy and provide guidance on the next steps. Here are some suggestions for professionals on how to convey the diagnosis and offer support to parents: + Choose the Right Setting: Find a quiet and private space to discuss the diagnosis, ensuring that you have enough time for the conversation without interruptions. + Empathetic Communication: Start by expressing empathy and understanding. Acknowledge the emotions they may be experiencing, which can include relief, shock, denial, or a range of other feelings. + Provide Information: Explain the diagnosis clearly and in simple terms. Offer educational materials or resources that parents can take home and review at their own pace. This might include brochures, websites, or books. + Answer Questions: Encourage parents to ask questions and address any concerns they may have. Be patient and provide honest, accurate information to the best of your knowledge. + Offer Emotional Support: Let parents know that their feelings are valid and that they are not alone. Mention local or online support groups or organizations where they can connect with other parents in similar situations. + Discuss Treatment and Intervention Options: Depending on the child's needs, provide information about available treatment and intervention options. This might include therapies like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), speech therapy, occupational therapy, and more. Discuss the benefits and potential next steps. + Referrals: If necessary, provide referrals to specialists or service providers who can further assess and assist the child. Explain the roles of these professionals and the importance of early intervention. + Develop a Care Plan: Work together with the parents to create a care plan tailored to their child's specific needs and strengths. This plan may involve therapies, educational programs, and other services. + Legal and Financial Guidance: Discuss any legal and financial matters, such as eligibility for government programs, insurance coverage, and educational rights, to ensure parents are aware of available resources. + Encourage Advocacy: Encourage parents to become advocates for their child's needs and rights. Provide information about special education services, Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), and the importance of being involved in their child's educational journey. + Recommend Reading Materials: Suggest books, articles, or online resources that can help parents better understand autism and learn strategies for supporting their child. + Follow-Up: Schedule a follow-up appointment to check on the family's progress, address any new questions, and assess how the child is responding to interventions. Remember that every family's situation is unique, and the way they react to the diagnosis can vary greatly. Your support, understanding, and guidance can make a significant difference in helping parents navigate this challenging but important phase in their child's life.",

      "content": "What causes autism? Most families first respond emotionally when they are told that their child is on the autism spectrum. Some go through denial; others are sad or furious. Soon, emotions give way to questions and one of these questions is - “What caused my child’s autism?” Parents often ask themselves what they could have done differently. Another thought is that if we know what causes autism, maybe we can “cure” it. Some parents also ask this question as they plan to have another child and wonder about the risk of the other child also having autism. The truth is, we do not really know the specific causes of autism. Therefore, it follows that there is no way any parent could have done anything different so their child would not have had autism. Also, since autism is a natural variation in neurodevelopment, currently there is no way to “cure” it. However, the information we have from current studies indicates that if one child in a family is autistic, there is a higher chance of having another autisitc child. ::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"} What we know about causes of autism is that there are a variety of factors - “a spectrum of causes” - behind the occurrence of autism, including genetic and environmental factors. ::: Genetic Factors Genetics plays a large role in the incidence of autism, as evidenced by a 2019 study of more than 2 million people across five countries, which estimated ASD’s heritability to be approximately 80%. The role of genetics is also indicated by the concordance rate (both of two siblings having autism). In siblings, who share 50% of their genes, the occurrence of autism in both the siblings (the concordance rate) is 20%. Similarly, in fraternal twins, who share 50% of genes and grow in the same womb, the concordance rate is 31%. However, genetics are not the only causal factor - this is evidenced by the concordance rate of 77% even in identical twins, who share 100% of their genes, and grow in the same womb. Here is a TED talk by Wendy Chung where she talks about genetic factors in autism. {{}} Genetics play a large role does not mean autism runs in the family. Certain individuals have it brand new because of mutations in the sperm or egg at the time of conception which are not passed down. Also, while we know genetics play a large role, the current studies do not provide information on what genes are involved, or even if it is a combination of genes. Furthermore, A study by Simons Foundation found that the genetic changes/ alterations were different for different individuals even among a population of 2600 that had brand new autism - this means there is not 1 gene, but about 300-400 genes (that are not random, but fit together in a pathway/ network) causing autism - possibly why there is such a wide spectrum of autism. Environmental Factors A variety of environmental factors have been examined for their contribution to autism. While there are studies that have found correlation between some environmental factors and the incidence of autism, it is important to note that the research is in early stages. The evidence for some of these factors is strong and for some, it is confusing or weak. While we know some of these factors play a role, we do not know how exactly how that role works. In addition, some factors like air pollution are so generic and so widespread that there is little anyone can do about them. So, while we know in general that there are a variety of environmental factors, we do not have a single, actionable, point that can make a significant difference. Some of the environmental factors that have a strong to moderate current evidence are: + the use of certain medications during pregnancy - Valproic acid (given for epilepsy), Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (Used to treat depression) + extremely preterm birth and low birth weight + Older parental age at the time of conception + Bacterial and viral infections in the mother while pregnant + Maternal autoimmunity As of now, we do not exactly know what causes autism. There is much research being conducted on both genetic and environmental causes and the early results are promising. However, if a family has a child on the spectrum now, it might be more important to ask what can help the child rather than what causes autism, since the second question is unlikely to be answered in the near future in a definite way that can change the current ways of supporting autism.",

      "content": "There are a lot of misconceptions around autism. Very often parents are blamed, or parents go ahead and blame themselves for the child’s autism. They may think that their parenting is responsible for the child’s autism or in the Indian context, they are likely to blame it on themselves and their bad ‘karma.’ This blame and guilt often push the parents into denial about the child’s autism or into depression believing there is something wrong with themselves. All of this is unnecessary and is only likely to waste precious time that can be better spent on working with children. Similarly, some parents believe that the child’s autism is not really autism, but a set of mild symptoms caused either by too much screen time, or due to lack of social interaction in nuclear families, or because the child has spent time around other children who have autism. Under this belief and the fear of the burden of autism, parents again waste precious time trying to take temporary measures like sending the child to a school to increase social interaction, leaving the children with grandparents, sending them to preschool etc. As we understand, autism research is still young, and we do not have a complete understanding of what exactly causes autism. As of now, what is clear is that a combination of several factors (genetics, parental age at the time of conception, other environmental factors- link to “what causes autism”) may cause autism and we have some clarity on what does not cause autism. The following are some factors that were identified as “causes of autism” earlier but have been ruled out through thorough research. Bad parenting It was once believed that “refrigerator mothers” meaning cold, uncaring, and emotionally unavailable mothers caused autism in children. Later, by the early 1970s, this cause was studied further, and the theory of refrigerator mothers was disproved. Vaccines One of the most prevalent myths among causes of autism is that vaccines, especially the Measle, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) and the mercury containing vaccines cause autism. This claim has been investigated thoroughly and no link between vaccines and autism has been found. See @sec-vaccines for more. Screen time It has been noticed that some children develop autism-like symptoms due to increased screen exposure before 3 years of age. Some studies suggest that increased screen time is associated with melanopsin-expressing neurons and decreasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter, and thus results in deviant behavior, decreased cognitive, and language development. This has been termed virtual autism. While the symptoms are similar, and virtual autism may be diagnosed as autism, these are two different conditions. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with genetic links and is thus present lifelong. On the other hand, virtual autism has a definite cause, which is excessive screen exposure at an early age/ Intensive Early Screen Exposure and unlike ASD, can be reversed if intervened at the right time and with the right corrective measures. There is no evidence that the autism spectrum disorder is caused by excessive screen time. Lack of social interaction For children on the spectrum, social interaction is a difficulty. They do not intuitively know how to socialize appropriately and may not always have a pleasant experience socializing. However, this is a symptom of autism and not a cause. Children on the spectrum retain their autism, irrespective of the social exposure they get in childhood. Social exposure may desensitize them to social situations but will not take away the autism from them. Thus, lack of social interaction may deprive the child from learning appropriate social skills but does not necessarily cause their autism. Interaction with people on the spectrum Some of us believe that if a child is spending time with a child on the spectrum, they may catch autism. But autism does not work like the flu. As we have discussed before, autism is neurodevelopmental and has genetic links. If a child is getting a diagnosis, it is because the child has always had autism. It may be diagnosed late due to various other factors (denial from parents, symptoms being masked etc.) Your child is not diagnosed with autism because he/she was spending time with another child who has autism. In summary, some popular beliefs, or apprehensions about the cause of autism have been conclusively proved to be wrong and an awareness of these can help parents focus their time and energy on more useful approaches to dealing with their children’s autism. Timeline of Various Causes of Autism 1949 - Kanner proclaims his theory that autism is caused by \"refrigerator mother\", a term used to describe parents who are cold and detached. 1964 - Refrigerator mother theory challenged with possible neurological factors (Rimland) 1967 - Refrigerator mother theory reinforced through the “Empty Fortress” book 1977 - First study of twins and autism- Genetics as important risk factor 1998 - Andrew Wakefield claims MMR Vaccine triggers autism 2010 - Andrew Wakefield’s paper retracted, barred from practicing medicine, and loses medical license. Autism research continues and so far, scientists have identified around 100 different genes and certain environmental factors that could contribute to the possibility of autism.",

      "content": "If you are remotely connected to autism, it is highly likely you have come across this question before. The answer is, no, vaccines do not cause autism. This theory was proposed in 1998, has been thoroughly investigated and conclusively proven to be false by 2010. What contributes to its widespread popularity and longevity? Origin of the vaccine connection In 1998, a physician by the name Andrew Wakefield made this claim in a paper published in the medical journal Lancet. During that time, the two most popular candidates for the cause of autism were refrigerator parenting and genetics/neurobiology. Wakefield looked at 12 children who were developing normally until the administration of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine and started exhibiting autistic symptoms shortly after. He believed that the vaccine affected the large intestine and assumed that neurotoxic proteins released through the intestine reached the bloodstream and brain, causing autism. His belief was strengthened when all the children he performed colonoscopies on exhibited the lesions. The theory made sense as autism symptoms in children started to appear around the same time as the vaccine administration i.e. 12 to15 months of age. “It was after the vaccine that my child stopped talking/ started behaving this way” is a common refrain one hears even today. The theory also gained popularity with parents as it took away the burden of blame from them. Autism cases were increasing rapidly, people were looking for a cause, and this plausible theory gained credence. Debunking the theory The vaccine link looked obvious and was convenient but other researchers were unable to replicate the findings. Also, considering the diversity of how autism presents itself, a common biological cause looked unlikely to the scientists. In 2005, an investigative reporter alerted the editors at Lancet that Wakefield's study had been flawed by severe research misconduct, conflict of interests, and falsehood. After investigating the matter, Lancet retracted the article, and the British Medical Association took disciplinary actions against Wakefield. Since then, any direct connection between autism and the MMR vaccine has been discredited by dozens of studies investigating the roots of autism and the biological effects of MMR and the mumps virus. Also, even as more parents were opting out of MMR vaccination, the rates of autism had been rising. Soon after, there was a suspicion about another autism-vaccine link. It was suspected that thimerosal, added to vaccines as a preservative, could cause autism. Thimerosal contains mercury, a poison, but there was no evidence that the small amount was harmful. To see if thimerosal was linked to autism, researchers studied children who received vaccines that contained it. They compared them to kids who received vaccines that did not contain thimerosal and did not find significant differences in the rates of autism. Even then, thimerosal was taken out of most vaccines. ::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"} Since 2003, there have been nine studies funded or conducted by CDC (Center for Disease Control) that have found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD (autism spectrum disorder). These studies also found no link between the MMR vaccine and ASD in children. ::: Researchers have also looked to see if all the vaccines required before age 2 together somehow triggered autism. Children receive 25 shots in the first 15 months of life. Some people feared that getting all those shots so early in life could lead to the development of autism but there is no evidence that this is true. The CDC compared groups of children who received vaccines on the recommended schedule and those whose vaccines were delayed or did not get them at all. There was no difference in the autism rate between these groups. Thus, through these several scientific studies, it has been concluded that there is no evident link between vaccines and autism.",

      "content": "When parents are told that their child has or is at risk of autism, their first reaction is shock and then disbelief. They often think “how can this happen to us?” and then go on to “why is this happening to us?” Most people spend about six months to one year trying to make sense of it. They try to rationalize the symptoms; they hope the diagnosis is not correct and that the child will achieve the milestones in another year and things will then be alright. People seem to believe autism is a rare condition and most people haven't heard of it before. However, the actual prevalence numbers tell a different story. The highest prevalence numbers come from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in the US. According to their 2020 estimates, 1 in 36 children aged 8 were on the autism spectrum - that is about 3 children per hundred. In the same year, CDC estimated the prevalence of autism in adults at about 2.21% - that is about 2 persons per hundred. The World Health Organization has a lower estimate of about 1 in 100 worldwide, based on a review of about 71 studies across the world from 2012-21. The prevalence numbers for India are not reliably available but the scientific community agrees that the biochemical pathways involved in core autism are unlikely to be different in different populations. This means that the prevalence of autism in India is likely to be closer to the worldwide estimates of about 1 to 3 people per hundred. This means about 1.3 - 1.5 crores of people on the autism spectrum, which is very significant. What do these prevalence numbers mean? It means we need more awareness about autism because it is not as rare as people believe. We need more awareness in new parents and to-be parents so we are all better prepared. It means we need more facilities, resources and a coordinated action plan for autism in place of the current status where the responsibility is with individual parents. There is another thing that comes to mind - World Health Organization estimates about 1 in 6 people across the world experience a ‘significant disability’ - that is about 16% of the population, numbering about 1.3 billion people. CDC also reports that about 1 in 6 (16%) children aged 3-17 years were diagnosed with a developmental disability in the study period of 2009-17. However, those of us who do not have any disability continue to believe that disabilities are rare, we ignore how common they are and continue to build a world that excludes those with disabilities. That way, people living with disabilities are one of the largest voiceless minorities in the world. In such a world, it is no wonder that people go on without awareness of the incidence of disabilities, they are not educated about the possibility of a disability in their children, and are shocked and surprised when something like autism shows up at their doorstep. These prevalence numbers should make us all aware of the size of the issue, jolt us out of the ignorance and get us started on the path of building more awareness, being more empathetic and inclusive in our daily lives. Listening to autistic people and including their perspectives in conversations about autism is vital for creating supportive and respectful environments.",

      "content": "Dental Care Handbook Dental care is a difficult to deal with aspect of autism, as it relates to many sensory triggers that people on the spectrum experience. In the presence of oral sensitivities, children find it difficult to open mouth, allow a brush inside, use appropriate pressure to brush etc. The resulting lack of oral hygiene causes issues starting from gum infections to dental carries, causes pain, restricts eating, and negatively impacts the overall health of individuals on the spectrum. Dental issues develop over a period of time when oral hygiene is not maintained. Dental problems also tend to be very painful impacting the mood and behavior of the autistic individual. On top of everything, going to dentist is also a difficult experience for many autistics. Therefore, preventive care becomes very important. The following information is focused on enabling dental care for young children. Tools included and how to use This resource includes two types of tools - Social Stories and Visual Lessons. Social Stories Social stories are a widely used tool to support autistic children in understanding and navigating everyday situations. These stories are simple, tailored narratives that break down complex behaviors into clear, manageable steps, helping children learn what to expect and how to respond in various settings. Social stories are also used to introduce and reinforce various day to day behaviours. Social stories can be presented in various formats, including written narratives, pictures, or even videos. They are often read repeatedly to reinforce learning and are most effective when used just before the situation they describe Visual Lessons Lessons and activities built around a visual structure like a graphic story book offer several advantages for helping autistic children learn activities of daily living (ADLs) by leveraging their visual learning strengths and providing structured, engaging ways to practice essential life skills. Here are some ways to use visual lessons. Joint Reading and Shared Attention: Read the book together, pointing to pictures and discussing each step. Encourage the child to ask questions or make comments about the story. Visual Schedules: Use illustrations from the book to create visual schedules or checklists for daily routines, breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps. Role-Playing and Reenactment: After reading, have the child practice the activity by following the sequence shown in the book. For example, after reading a story about brushing teeth, guide the child through the real-life steps using the book as a reference. Activities: Select appropriate activities included in the graphic story book and do them with the child. Personalization: Optionally, you can customize the books or activities to include the child’s own experiences, familiar people, or specific routines to increase relevance and engagement. Repetition and Reinforcement Read the same book multiple times to reinforce learning. Repetition helps children internalize routines and build confidence in performing ADLs independently. About the activities All the activities included with the graphic story books are anchored around conversations and discussions, which depend on facilitator's ability to ask the right questions, modify them as necessary and go with the responses. The objective of the activities is to ensure the learner participates and engages along with the facilitator, and not to test the knowledge or to challenge the learner. The nature of the activities, the visuals and the discussions, is such that by engaging in these activities, the learner is bound to learn. Therefore the key is to get the learner's cooperation, participation and engagement. Even if the learner does not respond with completely correct answers, it is likely they will learn to implement the steps in their daily lives. A note for parents All parents want their childrren to learn and look forward to that happy moment of learning. However, it is important to remember each child is different and has their own ways of being and responding. We can learn to understand there are and will be differences between parents' expectations and what the child is able to do or demonstrate at any point in time. Please seek help from an expert or the child’s therapist when you are unable to get a desired response from the child or feel stuck at any point.",

      "content": "Preventive dental care includes three important, related areas - food and Hygiene habits, Toothbrushing, Visiting a dentist. By focusing on enabling preventive care, we empower autistic individuals to engage in dental care mindfully, to self manage wherever possible and to make healthy choices. The following information is focused on enabling preventive dental care in young children. Food and Hygiene Habits Getting children to eat healthy foods is one of the primary aspects of oral hygiene. We need to think of well balanced diet in this context. Children should also eat fibre rich food which needs chewing so that their gums are exercised and the spaces between the teeth remains cleaner. Key things to keep in mind are: Eating foods that have lots of sugar is bad for teeth Having too much milk during the night or through the night, not gargling or cleaning the mouth afterwards are more likely to cause cavities Eating over-mashed soft food is not good for oral health. Cheese, beans, fresh fruits, raw vegetables, leafy greens are good for the teeth. Fizzy drinks, acidic fruits and sweets are bad for teeth. Common Behaviors that impact dental health Mouthing: Some children tend to keep everything in the mouth. That results in many microbes going into the body. Chewing: Some children keep everything in their mouth and also chew on them. This is bad for oral hygiene and may also cause injury to teeth and gums. Biting: Some children bite everything, like the edge of a table. Biting into really hard surfaces or things may damage the teeth. Recources and tools for Food and Hygiene Habits Planning to eat healthy Eating is a part of lifestyle. Also, modelling is very powerful. So, any change we expect in the food habits of the child has to be implemented by the entire family. The family should have a good routine for waking up and getting physical activity in the morning. It is important to drink water to stimulate bowel movement and build a sense of hunger. This is especially important for poor eaters. It is important to plan balanced meals. Have a weekly meeting to plan the menu. Make space for favourite foods like samosas, popcorn or chicken burgers. Decide on the quantities. Even if your child is not verbal, make them a part of the meeting and let them respond with yes or no. All this activity builds predictability and reduces anxiety about favourite foods. You can use the menu as an opportunity to build communication, create a sense of time through the calendar, build it into their weekly schedule, help them get into the habit of checking written instructions or schedules instead of asking the same questions again and again…the possibilities are endless! Remember children love food and it is a great motivator. Refer to the related resource on eating for more about managing children's eating habits. Addressing eating issues Children may have restrictive eating habits, texture sensitivities, chewing issues or may eat too fast or too slow. Based on the severity of the problem, we can choose eating interventions to address these issues. Refer to the related resource on eating for more about addressing eating issues. Eating right for healthy teeth - Social Story The social story focuses on basic oral hygiene practices. Read this story repeatedly to reinforce learning. Remember social stories are most effective when used just before situations they address. Also, ensure the social story in in accordance with the real life situation - if not, you can change the relevant portions and use it. {fig-align=\"centre\" width=50% .lightbox .img-border } {{}} Oral Hygiene Graphic Story Book and activities This Oral Hygiene book introduces ideas like the importance of healthy teeth, avoding sugary foods, and the need to brush daily.

      "content": "Most of the children with autism face issues with brushing. Tooth brushing is managed 'some how'. Some times, the strategies that are used to ensure children brush their teeth can result in trauma for the child, engendering negative attitudes towards brushing, and resulting in a lot of distress. A variety of issues that are often seen with children on the spectrum are - Unable to open mouth to brush, Unable to allow a brush inside the mouth, eats away the toothpaste, Unable to gargle, Unable to spit, Putting too much or too little pressure while brushing etc. What can a parent do Identify the issue - The specific issue that a child has to be identified correctly so an intervention can be planned. The person facilitating brushing needs to be clear with what the autistic person finds challenging and plan support accordingly. Not everyone needs everything. If it is a sensory issue, a separate intervention needs to be planned based on the issue - for example, getting specific kinds of toothbrushes like vibration brush, using specific flavoured toothpastes, planning specific massages to prepare the child for brushing. Acknowledge the difficulty - It is important to acknowledge the issues that the autistic person has with brushing Avoid feedback such as ‘Drama, ‘Too much’, 'everyone does brushing, what’s your problem’ etc. Rather, you can say, ‘I understand you are quite upset about brushing. Let us follow schedule and I am here to help you go through it'. Preparation - Preparation plays a huge role in developing a favourable attitude to brushing. Having a visual schedule which shows when it is time to brush is one of the key steps. Social stories and general story books about brushing can also help preparation.

This child has all the skills needed for brushing. He needs help with following a sequence. A visual prompt is a picture that the child/person refers to during the process. There is absolutely no need to give any kind of instruction. Notice that the facilitator does not say anything in the entire video. The facilitator just points to the picture and the child follows. The facilitator also gives counts where repetitions are needed. This ensures that the brushing is done for at least 2 minutes. The child could follow the sequence when the facilitator pointed to the picture. The facilitator did not say anything through out the video. This is crucial for the prompt to stay with the visual and not with the facilitator. The child kept referring to the visual prompt with support in the video. Eventually, the child learns to follow the visual by himself and follow the sequence. The child learns to brush by himself. {{}} Modelling and Physical Prompts{.unnumbered} A visual prompt works when a person has the skills to perform the different steps as shown in the prompt. What do we do when the person is not independently able to perform some steps? This video shows such a situation where we use a combination of visual, modelling and physical prompts. As a prerequisite, we need to have some idea of what the person can do independently and where they may need more help than just the visual. Visual prompt: We point to the visual prompt for the steps the person is able to perform independently. Modelling prompt: We use modelling for steps where the person can perform the action imitating the facilitator. Notice that the facilitator points to the visual, says 'Do this' and then performs the action. The person imitates. Notice that the only instruction is ‘Do this’ for modeling. Also, facilitator says 'Do this' to get the person's attention. If the person is already looking at the facilitator, even this instruction is unnecessary. Modelling can be done without instruction. Physical prompt: When the person finds it difficult to perform a step, the facilitator holds the hand and supports them to do the task. Notice that the facilitator points to the visual, holds the person's hand and then he performs the action. The physical prompt does not need any instruction. The facilitator also gives counts where repetitions are needed. This ensures that the brushing is done for at least 2 minutes. As the person becomes more fluent and independent in each of the stps, physical prompts can become modelling prompts, modelling can become visual prompt and eventually, the support can also be removed completely as the person starts to brush by themselves. {{}}",

Visiting a dentist periodically and learning to interact with the doctor, the people and the environment are important goals to pursue. It will facilitate preventive care which will aid good oral hygiene, education about dental hygiene as well as taking help when there is a need. However, it is important that the parents or the caretakers understand how challenging it is for the autistic person. The environment at a dentist’s place can be daunting for a person who has never been there. A chair that leans back gradually could throw a person into panic mode. The caretaker as well as the clinic must be sensitive to these experiences and expressions and respond with empathy. The caretakers should ideally carry whatever mode of communication the child uses so that they are able to respond by themselves. Do not hesitate to take a step back if the person wants to stop the process mid way. Just leave everything and go home. You can always prepare again and come. Instead, if you push through, it will cause trauma to the autistic person and any future references to a dentist might result in lots of emotional outbursts.

      "content": "Introduction Autism is a natural variation in how people’s brains work and experience the world. Autistic people may communicate, interact, and process information in ways that differ from the neurotypical majority. Because autism exists on a spectrum, each autistic person has their own unique strengths, challenges, and ways of engaging with their surroundings. Rather than viewing these differences as deficits, the neurodiversity perspective recognizes and values the diverse ways that brains can function and contribute to society. Throughout this document, we use identity-first language (such as “autistic person” or “autistic child”), in keeping with the preferences of many in the autistic community. However, we recognize and respect that some individuals may prefer person-first language. ::: callout-tip Video Available This video covers key points in understanding autism. ::: The onset of Autism Autism in children usually becomes noticeable around the age of 2 to 3 years, all though with increasing awareness, early identification is becoming more common these days. Parents may first notice that their child engages with the world in unique ways. Some autistic children might communicate or play differently, such as not always responding to their name, making eye contact, or using spoken words in the same way as their peers. They may have distinct interests and find joy in activities that are meaningful to them, like watching fans spin, flapping their hands, rocking, singing, or arranging objects in specific patterns. Some autistic children experience the world in ways that make transitions or unexpected changes particularly challenging. When routines are disrupted or sensory input becomes overwhelming, they may use strategies like focusing inward, seeking comfort in familiar activities, or engaging in repetitive movements—such as hand-flapping, rocking, or arranging objects—to self-regulate and manage their environment. These behaviors are meaningful ways for autistic children to cope with sensory overload or to express their needs, even if they look different from those of their peers. Parents might notice these differences in how their child interacts, communicates, or responds to their surroundings. Seeking support from professionals such as developmental pediatricians or psychologists can help families better understand their child’s unique sensory and communication needs and access resources that foster acceptance, comfort, and growth. Why is this happening? How to deal with this? While the exact reasons why some people are autistic are not fully understood, research suggests that a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors can influence neurodevelopmental diversity. Autism is a natural variation in how brains develop and function, and autistic people have unique ways of experiencing and interacting with the world. There is no need or way to “cure” autism, as it is not an illness or defect, but rather a different way of being. With understanding, acceptance, and appropriate supports, autistic individuals can thrive and lead fulfilling lives on their own terms, celebrating their strengths and contributions to the community. What does it mean for the parents, the child and family? The immediate implication of autism diagnosis for the parents is that they need to rethink their ideas of parenting and their expectations of the child. Children on the spectrum may have various neurological and physiological differences that cause them to experience the world very differently from other people. Parents need to be willing to learn about their child and how their autism works. They need to be open to learning about various therapies and educational approaches in order to learn to support themselves and the child. In the Indian context, where support from public institutions may be limited, a diagnosis of autism for the child may require the parents to radically rethink their lifestyle and goals. They may need to plan their lives such that one of the parents is available to support the child and coordinates with the doctors, therapists, school and other people who interact with the child. While families may face challenges as they learn to support their autistic child, many also discover new perspectives, joys, and strengths within their family as they embrace neurodiversity and celebrate their child’s unique qualities.",

      "content": "Once there is a diagnosis, the next thing to do is to think of various ways to start supporting the child. This usually takes the form of therapies - behavior therapies to start learning to understand and respond to the general behavior of the child; speech and language therapy to help open a channel of communication; occupational therapy or physical activities to help the child with physical regulation. The specific things that are done in each of the therapies depend on the specific strengths and needs of the child. Whichever of these therapies are chosen, one needs to ensure the therapies are aimed at making life easier for the child and the family. The goal of these supports is not to change who the child is, but to help them access opportunities, build on their strengths, and participate fully in their community.Over a period of time, the therapies are supposed to build the skills and competencies of the child, show the family how to support the child, and over all, add to the quality of life of the family. It also helps if parents continue to be involved in the therapies, understand the processes and learn the basic approaches, so that the child gets the same support whenever s/he needs it. It is important that any therapies or supports chosen are respectful of the child’s autonomy and preferences, and are never aimed at suppressing harmless autistic traits, but rather at empowering the child to thrive in their own way. How does schooling and education work? Schooling and educational needs may vary according to the child’s capabilities, needs and interests. Thus, it is important to first develop an Individualised Education Plan (IEP) for the child based on his/her strengths and needs. The IEP generally takes into account the strengths and needs of the child, as seen by different people supporting the child - parents, therapists, teachers etc. - and outlines a plan to equip the child with required competencies. Depending on the specific needs of the child, a child may go on to a mainstream school with accommodations or go to a special school. Some children may need additional help. Homeschooling may also be an option in some cases. Changing support needs of autistic people and families Autism is a spectrum, which means it is expressed differently in each individual. Every autistic person has their own unique strengths, challenges, and ways of experiencing the world. As the saying goes, “If you’ve met one autistic person, you’ve met one autistic person.” Some autistic people may have differences in coordination, communication, or motor planning, while others may also experience co-occurring conditions such as epilepsy, anxiety, intellectual disability, or depression. Each person’s needs and experiences are unique, and support strategies should be tailored to the individual. Families may sometimes find it challenging to navigate the various supports, therapies, and educational approaches available, especially in contexts where resources are limited. This can also impact the family’s ability to socialize and connect with their community, and they may encounter barriers or misunderstandings from others. As autistic children grow into teenagers and young adults, it is important for families and communities to continue learning, adapting, and supporting their evolving needs and identities. In India, there is a need for more inclusive opportunities and support systems for autistic individuals beyond childhood, including meaningful educational, vocational, and social options for teens and adults. As autistic individuals grow, supporting their self-advocacy and listening to their voices becomes increasingly important. Empowering autistic people to express their needs and preferences helps ensure that support is truly person-centered.",

While many autistic adults develop skills and strategies for navigating the world, autism remains an integral part of who they are throughout their lives. Because autism is a spectrum, the experiences and needs of autistic adults are diverse. Some may require ongoing support with daily living, health, or safety, while others may thrive independently or with minimal assistance. Many autistic adults benefit from supportive environments, understanding communities, and accommodations that help them manage sensory, social, or emotional differences. It’s important to recognize that needing support is not a reflection of someone’s value or potential, but simply a part of human diversity. In India, opportunities and resources for autistic adults are still growing. There is an increasing need for inclusive education, employment, and community participation options that respect and celebrate neurodiversity. By fostering acceptance and providing meaningful support, we can help ensure that autistic adults are empowered to lead fulfilling lives and contribute to society in ways that honor their individuality.",

      "content": "Early Intervention Once a child is diagnosed with autism and the parents have made some sort of peace with the diagnosis, the next question is, what do we do to help the child? This is when we talk about a variety of approaches called ‘early interventions.’ Early interventions like occupational therapy, speech therapy, and in some cases behavioral therapy are routinely recommended for children on the autism spectrum. A variety of other supplemental approaches like play therapy, music therapy, art therapy and in some cases horse therapy, water therapy and horticulture therapy are also offered. Here is a video on Early Intervention from Unmeed Child Development Center based in Mumbai. This video is about the importance of observing the developments in the first 3 years of a child’s life, outcomes of early intervention and the many roles therapists play. Here is a brief summary of the video: Observe how your child is developing closely and act promptly if you notice signs such as delayed speech, lack of eye contact, reduced vocalization, or limited interest in play compared to other children of the same age. Early intervention refers to a range of services and support provided to babies and young children (and their families) who show signs of developmental delays. During the first three years, if children miss or show delay in acquiring basic communication and other skills, early intervention can help. Families can also benefit from early intervention by learning how to provide a nurturing and supportive environment. Various therapists like speech therapists, Occupational therapists, Behavioural therapists play different roles and help in different ways. Parents need to seek assessment and support as soon as possible. {{}}",

      "content": "However, before we go further into what these therapies are and how to choose them, it may help to stop and ask what our goals are while we put the child through these early interventions. Yes, the child is on the spectrum, yes, she has certain challenges but then, what should early intervention help the child with? Once we are clear about the goals of for the child, we can go ahead and talk about choosing interventions accordingly. To start with, early childhood development goals for children on the spectrum are not different from the same goals for children in general. In both cases, one is looking for development along physical, social, cognitive, and emotional dimensions. However, children on the spectrum are likely to have a variety of specific challenges in these areas, and therefore, the goals are likely to be more specific. They may also find it difficult to learn these behaviors from the environment by observing and copying adults and other children, and so, may need suitably designed interventions and therapies. Communication Goals Children on the spectrum tend to face challenges related to speech, language, and communication. Some children may not be able to speak at all, due to poor motor coordination and other physical and neurological difficulties. Some children may be able to produce all sounds but limit their verbal interaction to a few words and not sentences. In some cases, children may be able to produce language fluently, as in be able to speak full sentences, recite poems etc. but may not be able to use language to communicate by asking questions, making observations etc. Many children may not understand verbal inputs and instructions. Some may be able to understand but may not be able to respond. Even in cases where children are unable to speak, they may show a willingness to communicate if the speech barrier is removed. In most cases, parents manage by trying to guess what the child means or wants. As the child grows up, this does not work and the inability to communicate leads to anxiety and other difficulties. So, an important goal is to help children develop a channel for two-way communication either using speech or using other alternative forms of communication. Social Goals Children on the spectrum also have a variety of social difficulties, starting with not responding when parents call their name, not being able to interact with parents. Children may not want to interact with peers or may not know how to take part in interactive games. They may behave inappropriately as they do not understand the rules of social behavior. For example, when in a play area, they may just follow other children around, copy their actions or snatch toys from others. So, teaching appropriate social behaviors and helping children cope with the demands of everyday social interactions at home, play areas and public places is another goal. Physical Goals Children on the spectrum may have physical challenges, with movement and balance. For example, many children walk on their toes, or find it difficult to hold erect posture while walking. Some are not able to balance naturally and so might find it difficult to walk up and down stairs, step over small obstacles like doorsteps etc. A few children may experience significant difficulties in coordinating their movements, to the extent of not being able to move around or use their hands without assistance. Many children also present with low muscle tone and overall poor motor coordination. One of the goals of early intervention is to help children develop better motor coordination and be able to navigate their world comfortably. Sensory Goals Children also present a variety of sensory challenges. Due to their neurological uniqueness, some children may have a different sensory experience than others. For example, some children are overly sensitive to the sound of a pressure cooker whistling. They may close their ears, run away, or show other unusual forms of distress around the noise. Some children find it difficult to handle different textures either to touch or to mouth. They may refuse to eat certain kinds of foods and may prefer to stick to one or two items of food. This preference might pose significant challenges when children end up eating only chicken nuggets or fruits and milk for years together. The interventions we choose need to address the sensory challenges of the child. Behavioral and Emotional Goals They may also experience a variety of behavioral and emotional challenges. Many children do not like to be disturbed when they are engaged in an activity and may find it difficult to transition from one activity or physical space to another. For example, a child might go to the play area and might resist coming back home. Or she might be playing with toys and may resist moving to the dining area for lunch. Children may also appear to not understand emotions – they find it challenging to read the emotion from facial expression and body language. Young children may not have enough linguistic and cognitive ability to understand emotions in the abstract. Guiding and helping children manage these variety of challenges needs to be among the goals of early intervention. Key Focus It is important to understand that the way a child experiences autism and the way it shows up through her behavior in the environment, comes from a combination of multiple factors. A child may not like the texture of food presented to her, may have a severe sensory response to it and may start feeling distressed. Now, she does not have language or other tools to communicate the same, does not understand the social behavior expected of her, and may start experiencing a serious emotional response. When a helpful adult tries to touch her, feed her, or talk to her, the added physical and verbal inputs further aggravate her distress. If she does not get help at this stage, she may resort to what is seen as ‘inappropriate behavior’ to communicate her distress. For the others around her, it looks like the child was offered tasty food, was encouraged to try out and taste it, but instead of doing what is expected, she has started closing her ears, shouting, kicking, and throwing the food around. However, the way she experiences the entire interaction is hugely different. As we have seen above, these difficulties sometimes work together to produce profoundly difficult outcomes, and it is important to take all these areas into account while planning the goals for early intervention. The focus is to understand the variety of ways the child is distressed by the environment, trace the distress back to various difficulties the child has, and try address these difficulties, while building her skills and competencies.",

      "content": "As discussed abovce, early intervention approaches need to address language and communication, social, physical, sensory, behavioral, and emotional goals. One therapy or approach is unlikely to address all these goals. Usually, a combination of behavior therapy like ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis), Speech and Language Therapy and Occupational Therapy are recommended. In addition, there are many other options like art therapy, music therapy, play therapy, animal therapy and so on. In the Indian context, there are alternatives like homeopathy, ayurveda and other traditional medicines. In addition, there are approaches like supplementary diets, medicines etc. In this era of internet, news media and social media, each of these proven or unproven treatments are promoted through stories of success. Also, since every person's autism is unique, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to address the needs of every person on the spectrum. There is an overwhelming amount of information available, and making an informed decision becomes a challenge. A few guidelines You should learn to critically evaluate the information you receive. Get information from objective sources. + People promoting various treatments may really want to help your child but may also have additional business motives. + Anyone making claims about “complete recovery” from autism or “curing” autism should be viewed with suspicion. There are no cures for autism. + The therapy approaches you choose should be evidence based. This means there should be enough scientific evidence that the approach works. Please remember that anecdotes are not evidence. Evidence-based practices include behavior approaches, developmental approaches like speech language therapy and occupational therapy. + The therapy approach or the combination of approaches you choose should be able to address all the goals mentioned above for the child. The therapy approach should enable you to get an assessment of your child’s specific needs in each of these areas and provide a comprehensive plan to progress on each of them. + The demands of the therapy approach should be aligned with your family’s capacity. For example, if a therapy approach needs you to spend more time with the child, you need to think of whether you can do this or not. It should also suit your financial ability. + Complimentary approaches involving working with art, music, movement, animals, swimming, play should be treated as complimentary therapies. These can be practiced in addition to the evidence-based early intervention approaches above. + Most methods of working with autism work slowly compared to the quick results one expects from medical treatments. That is the way it is. Anyone making time bound promises like “making your child school ready in six months” needs to be evaluated with caution. + Since there are no medicines for the core symptoms of autism, one needs to be cautious about medication as a solution. Please evaluate the medication carefully. With young children, it may be best to avoid medication except in case of severe medical conditions like seizures. + Extra caution is advised in using medication from ayurveda and other traditional medical systems. Most of these medications may be untested and unproven. Homeopathy may also be approached with caution – there are many controversies about whether it works at all. One of the problems with relying on unproven alternatives and medications is that these practices distract the family, divert attention from what needs to be done and may even interfere with the therapies. + Similarly, the efficacy of diets and supplements is at best questionable. An additional problem with restrictive diets is that children end up being deprived of many commonly consumed food items and may be nutritionally impacted. This feeling of deprivation may result in behaviors like grabbing food from others. Additionally, in the Indian culture where most social occasions revolve around food, children may also be socially impacted. While putting a child on a diet may look like an easy option, it may end up having profound consequences. In summary, the key to choosing a good approach is to go with one that is evidence based, addresses the development needs of the child, and suits the family circumstances.",

      "content": "After understanding the goals of early intervention and how to choose a therapy approach comes the question of how to choose a service provider for the therapy delivery and what to expect as you start working with them. Here are some thoughts that can help. Multifunctional Approach As we saw earlier, all the goals and needs of a child cannot be addressed by one therapy or approach. When working with multiple therapy providers, the parents end up having to coordinate between different therapists. In such cases, it is important to ensure the therapists are willing to work with you for this purpose. A better case would be when therapists are willing to talk to each other. The best is when a single service provider brings together the multifunctional team needed to meet all the therapy needs of your child. Family Centred While it is the individual with autism that receives the therapy, it is the entire family that is dealing with autism. A service provider willing to take a family centric approach should be preferred. The service provider should understand the importance of co-opting the family, keeping them involved, and support and train them, as necessary. Parental involvement and training become especially important when young children are involved as the children may benefit more when therapists and parents understand each other and work together. Assessments and plans When the therapy providers start working with your child, they should assess your child’s needs and develop an Individual Education Plan. Please ask the service providers what kinds of assessments they conduct to ensure they identify the specific needs and goals of your child. These assessments are necessary, so an individually designed therapy plan is developed for your child. This plan should also include details of how they plan to track and communicate the progress to you. Please insist that this plan be made and shared with you in a reasonable time. It is also important that the providers explain this plan to you in a way you can understand. Ideally, this plan should include your input and requirements as well. Clear communication At all points of time, the service providers should provide clear and transparent communication regarding the goals, the program, and the progress. Service providers should be willing to include parents and other caregivers in the therapy program. Respect and dignity Any practice that does not respect the individual with autism and the caregivers needs to be questioned. Individuals need to be treated with dignity and respect, irrespective of the goals and efficacy of the therapy. Parents and caregivers must be treated with respect and recommendations delivered respectfully. Most importantly individuals and parents should never feel pressurized or bullied by professionals. Training and qualifications Whether the therapy is provided by a single provider or by different providers, it is important for the parents to ensure that the therapists are well trained and qualified to deliver the therapy. Please do not hesitate to ask for details of certification and training. References and history When choosing a service provider, please ask for references and learn about the experience of other parents who have worked with them before. Please learn about how the providers deal with children, parental questions, and concerns and what the outcomes of the therapy were. In summary, the therapy provider you choose should take a multifunctional approach, involve the family, provide comprehensive therapy plans and progress tracking and be respectful to the individual with autism and the family.",

      "content": "One of the key features of autism is communication challenges. These include not understanding the importance of communication, not being able or willing to communicate, not being able to communicate appropriately in social situations, etc. In addition, an estimated 25 to 35 percent of people on the autism spectrum have little or no functional speech. Speech in autism is also along a wide spectrum, including those that speak fluently to those that do not speak at all. The usual words used in this regard are – minimally verbal for someone who uses little speech, nonverbal for someone with no speech and preverbal for young children. Like in many areas related to autism, the current research on non-speaking autism is limited, and we do not really know what causes functional speech difficulties. A variety of causes for limited speech in autism are possible: auditory processing, the system in brain that interprets words, might be poor; there could be motor planning issues like speech apraxia that impacts peoples’ ability to plan and coordinate mouth and tongue movements; differences in brain anatomy in the speech production network can also be involved. Communication is not just speech However, there is a difference between speech and communication – speech is the ability to produce words, whereas communication is the ability to convey and receive meaning. It is a misconception that children who do not speak cannot understand or communicate. It is also not true that those that can speak can automatically communicate and understand others. Also, people who do not or cannot speak do not have less intelligence scores than those who speak. They need communication as much as anyone else. Living in a world that revolves around language, speech and communication can be particularly challenging for people on the spectrum and more so for those that do not use much speech. The current assumption is that people who cannot communicate become frustrated and that becomes a trigger for various other unhelpful behaviors. Whether it is completely true or not, there is broad agreement among experts that having a two-way communication channel is important for everyone. Looking beyond speech - AAC Speech is particularly difficult for some people on the spectrum. We do not understand the reasons for these difficulties, but recognize that effective communication is important for everyone, and that speech is not the only way to communicate. It therefore makes sense to look beyond speech and enable everyone to find a channel of communication, using augmented and alternative communication (AAC) as necessary. AAC is a broad category that includes sign language, gestures, pictures, written words, and electronic devices. This is not to say that speech is not necessary or important. Speaking and understanding spoken language can make life significantly easier for people on the spectrum and their families. However, considering the difficulties they have with communication and speech, limiting oneself to speech-only approaches can be counterproductive. It is advisable to explore the use of AAC for communication, as early as possible. AAC can provide a communication channel for people on the spectrum who have difficulties with speech and communication. It has been shown that even with people who speak, the use of AAC can make communication more effective, by providing a necessary scaffold. Also, the common apprehension that use of AAC stops children from acquiring speech is not true, as shown by a 2021 study, among others. In summary, communication is a key element of working with autism and needs to be highly prioritized. People who find it difficult to speak should be supported with augmented and alternative communication as needed. Video - Make it Visual - help your child understand you In the video below, Dr. Nanditha De Souza of Sethu talks about how visual support help a child understand information better. Visual support is a form of AAC that helps a child communicate easily. Speech Therapy is not just about speech Yes, speech therapy and speech therapists are not all about “speech.” A speech therapist is really a speech language pathologist (SLP), but they are not just about language either. The overall goal of SLPs is to help a person communicate in functional ways. Communicating in functional ways certainly includes learning to use speech and language for communication but may also include learning to read nonverbal communication like facial expressions and gestures, learning to communicate in social situations etc. When working with people on the spectrum, the focus of SLPs is to holistically improve the ability to communicate and that may include using augmented and alternative communication (AAC). Communication and speech related challenges vary widely from person to person on the autism spectrum. Some individuals may not be able to produce any sounds, some may be able to produce speech but may not be able to use it to communicate, and at the other end, some may be able to speak fluently yet may have difficulty sticking to a topic or communicating appropriately. Accordingly, SLPs perform a variety of functions. Functions of Speech Therapists + Prelinguistic skills – help children learn skills like eye contact, gestures, vocalizations + Nonverbal communication – help people learn to notice nonverbal signs in a conversation + Feeding interventions – some individuals tend to have difficulties with chewing, swallowing etc. Some SLPs are trained to help in these areas. + Assisted and Augmented Communication (AAC) - SLPs can also train people in using AACs to communicate. These may include Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), sign language or electronic devices. + Speech fluency – SLPs can help people on the spectrum with speech clarity, and fluency. + Articulation – Speech requires coordination of different structures. SLPs can help improve the muscle strength, coordination and manipulation needed to produce speech. + Grammar – many children on the spectrum struggle with grammar and sentence structure. SLPs can help them understand language + Functional Speech – echolalia, repetition of sounds, words and phrases is a common coping mechanism. SLPs can help in building functional speech. + Social skills – SLPs can help coach people on the spectrum to communicate in different settings, either in one-to-one sessions or group sessions. + Social communication – SLPs can help children use language for different purposes like demanding, informing, commenting. + Transition to work – SLPs can also continue to help as the individual transitions to a work environment by coaching how to communicate in written and spoken forms. When working with an individual on the autism spectrum, SLPs assess strengths and challenges and develop a program with goals for the person and the approaches to achieve them. This program then becomes the basis for working together and assessing the effectiveness of the therapy. Parents of children on the spectrum should understand that the goal of the SLP is to facilitate communication and be willing to prioritize functional communication. A two-way channel of communication is the most important need of a child on the spectrum. Choosing an SLP SLP is an important member of the team of experts working with your child. Choose someone whose program matches your priorities and goals. Remember that functional communication is the priority, over speech or being able to repeat rhymes or learning alphabet. Ensure the SLP is willing to work with other experts either directly or through you. Work towards building transparency in your relationship with the SLP. You should know what is happening in the session and be trained to carry out some interventions at home, as needed. * Choose someone who can help with AAC as needed, training you, the child and others who interact with the child. In summary, speech therapy is not just about speech or language but about holistic communication. A speech therapist is an important member of the team working with your child and should be chosen carefully to align with the child’s goals and requirements.",

      "content": "May people on the autism spectrum face motor difficulties. They may have gross motor difficulties, such as a clumsy way of walking or difficulty with large motor movements or difficulties with fine motor skills like writing, coloring in the line or using scissors. Some may have trouble coordinating movements between the right and left sides of the body making it difficult to skip, jump, hop or get down the stairs. Some others may have trouble with hand-eye coordination making it difficult to catch a ball, hit a ball with a bat etc. In addition to these motor difficulties, children on the spectrum may also struggle with low muscle tone, sensory processing issues (too much or too little response to sensory inputs such as sound, touch, smell etc.), as well as difficulties with proprioception and interoception. It has been estimated in a 2020 study conducted in the US that as many as 87% of children between 5 and 15 years of age on the spectrum face motor difficulties. Yet, only about 30% of the children were receiving any therapy for the same. Motor issues may appear in infancy where 1-month old infants who are later diagnosed with autism move their arms less, they may struggle to keep their head in line with shoulders when pulled up to sit at 4 months and may struggle to stand at 14 months. Poor motor skills may contribute to and accentuate autism traits as motor issues can delay babbling, gesturing, and acquisition of new vocabulary. Lack of motor skills may also elicit less interaction from caregivers and provide children less prompts for learning. Poor motor skills later in childhood may make children on the spectrum reluctant to participate in physical activities, limiting opportunities for social interaction. Bad handwriting can impact academic performance. Since visual-motor integration skills are important for imitation and learning from others, lack of these skills can hamper social development. Thus, motor difficulties might have cascading effects on cognitive, social, and emotional development. That is why occupational Therapy is among the top therapies recommended for autism. The general focus of occupational therapy is to improve the client’s ability to participate in activities of daily living, which may include things like schoolwork to dressing and brushing teeth. When an occupational therapist starts working with a child, they usually assess their support needs. They may use some tests like the school function assessment test (SFA), Children’s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment/Preference for Activities of Children (CAPE/PAC), Assessment of Life Habits (Life-H), Children Movement Assessment Battery for Children Second Edition (Movement ABC2), Sensory Integration and Praxis Test (SIPT) etc. In addition, the therapist may observe the child in a range of settings to see if they are able to complete tasks of daily living. For example, they may watch to see if a child can button a jacket, cut with scissors, play appropriately in the playground, etc. Once the tests and observations are complete, they develop an individual plan for the child. The plan is personal and may include academic goals like using scissors, printing letters, using a paint brush; daily living skills like brushing teeth, zipping jacket, tying shoes; social functioning goals like catching a ball, jumping on trampoline etc. Occupational therapists usually work with the children in occupational therapy rooms or sensory rooms equipped with exercise balls, swings, jump ropes and other equipment. Therapists use techniques to strengthen the child’s hands, legs, and core, provide tools like weighted vests or large pencils to make some tasks easier etc. The role of occupational therapists is not limited to working with children. They may work with adults to build living skills like cooking, cleaning etc. They may help with designing more comfortable workstations and equipment for adults working in offices. They can help in various areas of self-care, productivity, and leisure. Sensory Processing and Occupational Therapy We rely on the information coming from our senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) to make sense of the environment around us. People on the autism spectrum may have difficulties dealing with the information coming in from different senses. A child may be distracted by the noise of a drill that you can barely hear. Another child may be feeling uncomfortable with the shirt label scratching on their neck. Yet another child might be getting overwhelmed with the perfume in the air. Too much sensory information can cause stress, anxiety, and physical pain. This can result in withdrawal, distressed behavior, or meltdowns. Different sensory profiles People on the autism spectrum can be under sensitive, oversensitive or both (at separate times) to any of their senses. For example, people who are under sensitive to sight may not have a good depth perception and may not be able to catch or throw. Those who are oversensitive may find it difficult to sleep even with a little light around. People who are under sensitive to sound may prefer crowded, noisy places or bang doors and objects. Those that are oversensitive to sound may not be able to filter our background noises, leading to difficulties in concentrating. People under sensitive to smell may sometimes lick things to get a better sense. Those that are oversensitive may have difficulties using toilets or may dislike people with distinctive, strong perfumes. People under sensitive to taste may like very spicy food. They may also eat or mouth non-edible items such as stones, dirt, soil, feces etc. This is known as pica. People with sensitivities to taste may end up with a restrictive diet. People under sensitive to touch may hold others tightly, enjoy heavy objects like weighted blankets on top of them. They may have a high pain tolerance and may self-harm. Those oversensitive to touch may not like to be touched and may have difficulties brushing and washing hair. They may also tolerate only certain types of clothing or textures. Working with sensory processing In general, people who are under sensitive to a sense seek out more of that sensory input to calm themselves, to relieve anxiety and sometime just for pleasure and relaxation. Those that are oversensitive try to avoid that sensory input for the fear of being overwhelmed. People on the spectrum may need help in handling these sensitivities. The general approach is to provide manageable alternatives to the under sensitive system and to slowly desensitize the oversensitive system through gradual exposure. For example, if a child is easily overwhelmed by sounds, she may close her ears every time someone speaks to her, losing out on useful information and learning opportunities. The therapy approach in this case would be to offer her earmuffs that can decrease the intensity of the noise, couple the sound input with a visual and gradually help the child be comfortable with the sound of spoken voice. A child who is under sensitive to touch may keep scratching walls or rough surfaces for stimulation, causing injury to fingers and nails in the process. In this case, the therapist may offer a manageable alternative by giving her a polystyrene sheet to scratch and get the sensory input. Sensory Integration Therapy Occupational therapists trained in dealing with sensory processing difficulties can help by providing interventions to target each sense, helping the child’s nervous system become more organized and regulated. Sensory integration therapy is one of the names given to such an approach. One of the options is to put a child on a sensory diet, a specially designed daily activity plan that provides the child with a variety of sensory activities. The focus is to help the child be regulated and improve attention and focus. When the child’s arousal level is too low, they can be given stimulating activities like dancing, singing, light exercise etc. When the arousal level is high, they can be given calming activities like going for a walk, reading, listening to music etc. It is important to choose activities that suit each child and provide the appropriate level of arousal or relaxation. Sensory Circuits Sensory circuits are another tool used by therapists to help children achieve a ready-to-learn state. Each session includes three elements. + Alerting activities to stimulate the body's central nervous system in preparation for learning. For example, spinning, bouncing on a gym ball, skipping, star jumps + Organizing activities which demand brain and body to work together. For example, balancing on a wobble board, log rolling, juggling + Calming activities give an awareness of their body in space and increase the ability to self-regulate sensory input. For example, heavy muscle work and deep pressure like wall pushes, pushups, using weights. In summary, some people on the spectrum may have sensory processing difficulties that make it difficult for them to process sensory information. Occupational therapists trained in sensory integration can help by designing sensory diets and other programs that can help children be more regulated, calmer, and focused, thereby reducing anxiety and increasing opportunities to thrive and achieve in the overwhelming environment in which we now live. Beyond the five senses We are all familiar with the five senses – sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. However, there are three other senses that are not as well known. In the context of autism, it is important to know about these senses as people on the spectrum tend to experience processing difficulties related to these senses as well. The three other senses are – Proprioception, Interoception and Vestibular system. Proprioception is our body’s intrinsic ability to sense and position itself in space. We have a set of sensory receptors in our muscles, joints, and tendons, that help us with full-body awareness. Interoception is our ability to sense our internal body states and emotional states, using the information we receive from receptors on our internal organs. The vestibular system is in our inner ear and helps us with our sense of balance and body control. Proprioception People on the spectrum can have proprioceptive difficulties that make it difficult for them to apply the right amount of pressure for a task. They also bump into things often and may have difficulties walking up and down stairs. They may struggle while feeding themselves, and frequently miss the mouth. They may also struggle with posture and movement fluidity when faced with a new motor task. They may underperform in sports and may struggle to remember the body posture associated with a new skill. Proprioception difficulties can be addressed by occupational therapists using sensory integration techniques and practicing gross and fine motor movements with visual assistance like looking into a mirror while performing a task. Interoception Regarding interoception, people on the spectrum may be less aware of what is happening inside their bodies. The interoception center in our brains is called the insular cortex, which also plays a vital role in the perception of pain, primary emotions like joy, anger, awareness of bodily states like feeling of cold, and in the perception of being a self. Therefore, interoception difficulties may be responsible for emotional processing issues, problems in identifying and describing emotions, and difficulty with empathy and perspective taking. At an extremely basic level, people on the spectrum may not be able to recognize when they are thirsty, or hungry. They may not realize when they are full and may tend to overeat. They may find it difficult to self-regulate their emotions, attention, and behaviors. They may not be able to point to the source of their discomfort like where the pain is. Interoception can be improved by practicing interoception awareness activities like guided self-body scans, deep breathing, guided progressive relaxation. Young children may need support with the help of timers for eating, drinking and toileting, portion control to help eat for balanced nutrition etc. Vestibular system The vestibular system refers to the structures in the inner ear that detect movement and change in the position of the head. This is the system that tells us if our head is upright or tilted, even with our eyes closed. Children who are oversensitive to this system can have fearful responses to ordinary movement activities like swings, slides, ramps etc. They may appear clumsy and fearful of moving in space. However, some children may actively seek intense sensory experiences such as excessive whirling, jumping, climbing heights, etc. Vestibular dysfunction can cause postural instability, gait dysfunction and impaired gaze. This can lead to delayed milestones such as sitting and walking and poor motor coordination. Vestibular dysfunction may be accompanied by auditory sensitivity and dysfunction. Repetitive actions like mild rocking can help calm down an over stimulated vestibular system. Providing structured activities that satisfy an under sensitive system seeking stimulation can also help. In summary, the sensory processing disorder, and related difficulties in autism go beyond the five better known senses and may impact proprioception, interoception and vestibular system. The impact of these dysfunctions is still being researched and understood. An occupational therapist can provide sensory integration therapy to help with these difficulties.",

      "content": "Entering Adulthood Entering adulthood marks a major life shift. For young people on the autism spectrum, this milestone often comes with exciting new possibilities alongside sudden changes in supports, routines, and expectations. If the teenage years were shaped by school-based services, structured schedules, and guided planning from teachers and family/ caregivers, adulthood can feel like stepping into new and unfamiliar territory. As independence grows, so does the need to reimagine support. The goal is not to remove structure but to help the young adult co-create new ones suited to their strengths, interests, and evolving identity. The “Services Cliff” In most education systems, the rights to school-based support and services—like individualized education plans (IEPs), transportation, occupational and speech therapy, or transition counselling—end around age 18 to 21. For many autistic young people, this shift brings what researchers call the “services cliff.” The “cliff” refers to the steep drop-off in structured supports that happens after school ends. In one study, while 87% of students on the spectrum received services during school, only 26% continued to receive them afterwards. This leaves many families navigating complex adult systems, new eligibility criteria, and bureaucratic layers just as the young person is trying to build independence. Without preparation, this transition can feel like moving from a well-marked path to an unknown stretch of road. The impact can include delays in vocational growth, challenges in self-management, and emotional strain. Yet this transition point is also a chance to reimagine support—from formal, school-based systems to community-linked, interest-driven opportunities. Transition planning: beginning in the teen years Early planning is the strongest protection against the services cliff. Ideally, this begins by age 14–15, when school, families, professionals associated and the young person can start visualizing adult life. Transition planning is most successful when it centers the young adult’s voice—what they enjoy, what they want to explore, and what kind of life balance feels right. When we speak of independence, especially in the context of young autistic people moving into adulthood, the image is often one of “doing everything on my own.” But for many autistic adults, independence is more nuanced. Research shows that autistic adults define and experience independence in ways that differ from the traditional, neurotypical narrative — and that accepting support is often a key part of that independence. A ground-breaking qualitative study of autistic adults in the UK found three core themes: - “Independence is ‘not a one-size-fits-all’” — Autistic adults emphasised that independence is a relative concept, unique to each person’s preferences, strengths, supports and life context. - “There is no one definition or concept of independence for autistic people; these are relative and uniquely individual.” - “Being autistic has its setbacks in a neurotypical world” — Many autistic adults face structural, sensory, communicative, and mental-health barriers when trying to live independently in what is still often a neurotypical environment. - “Finding ways of making it work” — Autistic adults highlight strategies: seeking help when needed, building scaffolding, choosing supports, recognising fluctuations in capacity, and redefining independence as making choices rather than doing everything solo. Key elements of transition planning include: - Accepting help is not a failure of independence; it can be integral to it. - Exploring strengths and interests: Identify what the young person enjoys—creative arts, technology, helping others, research, nature etc.—and link these interests to future work or learning options. For the teenager to choose interests, they must have been exposed to various opportunities, responsibilities, and support as they grow up, giving them the fair opportunity to choose their strengths, challenges and interests. - Building life skills: Daily activities like food preparation, budgeting, travel, and communication all contribute to autonomy. Encouraging routine practice of these, builds confidence. - Gradual independence: Shifting small responsibilities—scheduling appointments, managing an allowance—fosters self-trust and reduces future overwhelm. Mapping adult supports: Learn about local vocational, therapy, and social programs early to avoid gaps after school. - Emotional preparation: Talk about change, uncertainty, and growth. Reinforce that every adult continues learning adaptive skills throughout life. Independence often relates not just to functional skills (cooking, laundry, travel) but to emotional, cognitive, social dimensions: self-advocacy, recognising when one needs rest, balancing strengths and limits. - Planning is not a one-time event but a continuous dialogue that evolves with the person. In sum: a transition plan that frames independence as “having choices, making decisions, finding the support you need and growing your capacity to act” is more aligned with autistic adult experience than “doing everything by yourself from day one.” Emotional impact of sudden change in structure For many autistic adults, the end of school brings both freedom and uncertainty. The removal of routine—fixed schedules, daily travel, known teachers—can trigger feelings of anxiety, loss, or aimlessness. Families may observe changes such as increased stress, withdrawal, or frustration. These are often responses to loss of predictability, not a lack of motivation. Parents and carers too experience their own transition: from being organizers of services to partners in adult life. Recognising that this shift can feel disorienting is essential for both sides. Building emotional resilience means allowing space for grief over what’s ending—and curiosity for what’s next. Ways to ease this emotional adjustment include: - Creating new daily or weekly structures that include meaningful activity and downtime. - Connecting with peer groups or mentors—especially autistic adults who’ve navigated similar transitions. - Seeking counselling or peer support for managing anxiety, uncertainty, or family stress. - Celebrating small steps toward independence, rather than expecting instant readiness. In the Indian context In India, adult services for autism are still emerging. Many families rely heavily on school systems, and when these end, there can be very few adult-focused programs or agencies. Public awareness is improving, but gaps remain in supported employment, post-school education pathways, and community-based living options. However, India’s strong family and community networks can also be sources of resilience. Families can build local support through self-help groups, NGOs, and peer networks. Encouraging inclusive college programs, vocational training, and flexible workplaces contributes toward a more welcoming adult landscape. Planning early, staying connected, and using collective advocacy are key tools. Moving forward with hope Adulthood is not a single leap—it’s a series of steps, sometimes uncertain, often full of possibility. The “services cliff” is real, but it doesn’t have to be a fall. With preparation, collaboration, and community, every young person can enter adulthood with purpose and dignity, supported by the scaffolding that lets them thrive on their own terms.",

      "content": "Adulthood brings new chapters in every individual’s life — work, relationships, home, and health — and for autistic adults, these paths can be as diverse as the people themselves. There isn’t one single “trajectory” of autistic adulthood but rather an array of life courses shaped by personality, support access, opportunity, and environment. Understanding this diversity helps families, professionals, and communities imagine adulthood beyond a one-size-fits-all narrative. Developmental trajectories in adulthood Research over the last two decades paints a mixed picture of adult outcomes. Many autistic adults continue to grow in self-awareness, communication, and life skills throughout adulthood, especially when supported by inclusive systems and ongoing learning opportunities. However, structural barriers — not lack of ability — still limit access to meaningful work, housing, and community participation. Employment: Globally, full-time employment rates for autistic adults remain low, averaging around 25%, though many more engage in part-time, self-employment, or volunteer work. Job satisfaction is often high when environments match autistic strengths — routine, precision, creativity, and honesty. Housing: Most autistic adults live with family or in supported housing. Independent living is often possible with adequate community and financial support. Studies emphasize that living “independently” doesn’t necessarily mean living alone, but living with choice and dignity. Health: Access to healthcare and mental health support remains uneven. Co-occurring conditions like anxiety and depression are common, but adults report better health outcomes when employment, stable housing, and supportive networks are in place. Relationships: While friendships and romantic partnerships can bring joy and structure, many report social isolation or loneliness due to stigma or lack of accessible spaces. Community belonging, peer groups, and neurodiverse spaces can improve social satisfaction significantly. Outcomes are influenced by early support, access to services, inclusive policies, and personal environment — not by autism itself. Diversity of outcomes — a “spectrum within the spectrum” No two autistic adults share the same path. Research shows vast variation, or what scientists call “heterogeneity,” across employment, living, health, and social outcomes. A person who thrives in structured work environments may still need support for daily living, while another may excel socially but find traditional employment inaccessible. This “spectrum within the spectrum” reflects how life experiences, co-occurring conditions, family supports, and societal attitudes interact over time. Outcomes have also improved over generations: earlier access to therapies, more inclusive schooling, and growing social awareness enable more adults to lead fulfilling lives. Recognizing diversity means moving away from comparisons and toward individualized definitions of success. Each person’s blend of autonomy, belonging, and purpose is unique — and valid. Measuring success beyond independence For years, adult outcomes were measured by how “independent” someone became — through jobs, housing, and minimal support. Yet researchers and autistic self-advocates increasingly emphasize that success should capture well-being, not just self-sufficiency. Measures of success are maturing to include satisfaction, relationships, safety, purpose, and self-advocacy. Someone may rely on daily supports yet lead a rich, meaningful life filled with creativity, routine, and connection. Others may live alone but feel isolated or burnt out. Both realities deserve understanding and respect. The emerging “capabilities approach” — adapted from philosopher Martha Nussbaum — reframes adult outcomes to ask whether a person has the real freedom to live well, make choices, participate in community, and grow throughout life. It invites us to see adulthood not as a fixed state of independence but as an ongoing process of thriving in interdependence. In India, adult support remain limited, but opportunities for change are growing. More city programs, NGOs, and inclusive employers now create nuanced paths for autistic adults. While formal metrics like employment or housing autonomy remain challenging due to systemic and infrastructural gaps, many families build informal support systems and community-based work models. In this context, success is not measured by separation from family but by the quality of life within interdependent relationships — meaningful engagement, emotional balance, and community inclusion. A broader view of adulthood Adulthood for autistic people is not just about reaching milestones but about designing a life that fits. It may involve combining paid work with creative pursuits, relying on support staff while forming close relationships, or focusing on health and personal joy over economic measures. Outcomes may differ, but meaning, dignity, and belonging remain universal goals. A neurodiversity-affirming view acknowledges that adulthood is not a race toward independence — it is a journey toward a well-lived, authentic life supported by community, choice, and acceptance.",

      "resource": "Being an Adult Autistic",

      "content": "For many adults, discovering they are autistic later in life is a transformative experience — one that reframes how they understand their histories, their ways of thinking, and their relationships with the world. Late diagnosis can arrive with relief, recognition, and sometimes grief — relief at finding an explanation, pride in identity, and sadness for the missed years of understanding and support. But at its heart, this discovery can open doors to belonging, self-advocacy, and self-acceptance. Adults who discover their autism later in life Research shows that autism is far more common in adults than previously understood. About 1 in 45 adults in the U.S. are autistic , and recent evidence suggests that approximately 90% of middle-aged and older autistic adults remain undiagnosed, particularly those over 40. Diagnosis rates among adults have increased significantly — one study reported a 450% rise between 2011 and 2022, particularly among people aged 26 to 34. Many older adults grew up at a time when autism was defined narrowly and often associated only with children who had significant support needs. As a result, generations went unidentified — sometimes referred to as the “lost generation”. For many, traits like intense focus, sensory sensitivity, or burnout were misunderstood as personality quirks, anxiety, or depression. When a diagnosis finally comes, it often feels like a long-delayed confirmation that pieces of their life finally make sense. For women and gender-diverse adults, underdiagnosis has been especially widespread, as early diagnostic models were based primarily on male traits. Late discovery can validate their lifelong experiences of masking, misunderstanding, and exhaustion, and bring new language for self-understanding. Reframing autism as identity, not just condition Receiving a diagnosis in adulthood often leads to a deeper re-evaluation of self: autism becomes not merely a clinical label but a core part of identity. For many, it explains how they experience communication, sensory input, and relationships — not as deficits but as differences. Across community spaces and research, there has been a growing movement toward seeing autism through a neurodiversity-affirming lens: that neurological differences are a natural part of human diversity. This reframing can transform the internal narrative from “something wrong with me” to “this is who I am.” Late-diagnosed adults often describe experiencing grief for the years spent misunderstanding themselves — but also empowerment in reclaiming a fuller, truer story. Understanding one’s autistic identity can also reshape relationships with partners, family, and friends; it allows for new boundaries, honest communication, and the confidence to advocate for sensory or social needs without apology. Autistic pride, self-advocacy, and community belonging Autistic adults often find connection and healing in community spaces — online and offline — where they can meet others who share similar experiences. Self-advocacy groups, neurodiversity collectives, and social media communities have become crucial platforms for support and identity affirmation. Autistic pride, like other movements celebrating identity, is about visibility, self-determination, and reclaiming narratives from medical and deficit-centered models. It asserts that being autistic is not something to hide or “overcome,” but something to understand, accommodate, and celebrate. Community belonging offers more than friendship — it offers perspective. Listening to other autistic adults helps people reframe challenges, share coping strategies, and build solidarity. For many, it is the first time they are seen and understood without needing to mask or explain. In the Indian context In India, awareness of adult diagnosis is still developing. Adults discovering their autism often face limited access to diagnostic professionals and few adult-focused support services. However, online groups, NGOs, and mental health practitioners are increasingly recognizing the need for adult assessment and peer support spaces. Culturally, the emphasis on family involvement can be both a challenge and a support: some adults worry about being misunderstood or dismissed, while others find that sharing their diagnosis allows families to adjust expectations and rebuild empathy. Encouraging open conversations about neurodiversity — in workplaces, universities, and mental health settings — is helping dismantle the stigma that once surrounded adult diagnosis. A broader sense of self Late diagnosis can be the beginning of self-trust. It affirms that there was nothing “wrong” — only a difference unrecognized. Beyond diagnosis lies identity: a sense of belonging within the wider neurodiverse community and an understanding that life’s value is not measured by conformity but by authenticity. Autistic identity is not a label to limit but a language to live by — a framework through which adults can find meaning, self-respect, and connection. In embracing this identity, late-diagnosed adults reclaim not just their past, but also the possibility of thriving in their own unique, brilliant ways.",

      "resource": "Being an Adult Autistic",

      "content": "Navigating tensions in work, family, and relationships poses unique challenges for autistic adults. Differences in communication styles, sensory processing, and emotional regulation can lead to misunderstandings and escalating conflicts. However, with a deeper understanding of these differences, alongside neurodiversity-affirming counseling and practical dialogue strategies, autistic adults and their support networks can foster healthier interactions, reduce tensions, and build stronger connections. Understanding Common Sources of Tension Autistic adults often experience difficulties interpreting unspoken social rules, subtle cues, and indirect communication, which are common in workplaces, homes, and intimate relationships. For example, in the workplace, expectations like “you’ll just know” or indirect feedback can cause confusion and anxiety. Families may face challenges when one member values logic while another emphasizes emotional attunement, or when sensory boundaries are crossed unknowingly. Romantic partners sometimes struggle to reconcile explicit versus implicit communication styles, leading to accumulated misunderstandings. Moreover, sensory sensitivities—such as to noise, light, or touch—can heighten stress and reduce one’s ability to regulate emotions during conflict. Executive functioning differences may make it harder to organize thoughts, respond quickly, or shift attention amid tension. These factors combined often cause autistic adults to avoid conflict—sometimes sacrificing boundaries and personal values—because unresolved conflict feels overwhelming. At the same time, autistic adults possess valuable strengths like directness, loyalty, fairness, and focused problem-solving that, when appreciated and supported, contribute to effective collaboration and positive relationships. Neurodiversity-Affirming Counseling: A Foundation for Emotional and Social Growth Effective counseling tailored for autistic adults respects neurodiversity—the understanding that autism reflects natural neurological differences rather than deficits needing correction. This approach fosters acceptance and works with the individual’s unique processing style, often incorporating structure, clear goals, and opportunities for skill practice. Adapted Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is commonly used to help autistic adults manage anxiety and emotional responses by breaking down overwhelming challenges into concrete, manageable steps. Social skills and life skills training provide explicit instruction on recognizing social cues, initiating conversations, and understanding workplace or family dynamics. Couples and family therapy adapted for neurodiverse communication styles emphasize mutual recognition of differing needs and collaborative conflict resolution, helping all parties develop strategies that honor unique preferences without forcing conformity. Key counseling features include therapists trained in adult autism who pace sessions appropriately, use concrete examples, incorporate sensory-friendly adjustments, and actively promote self-advocacy—teaching clients how to communicate their needs clearly and confidently. Practical Strategies: Building Bridges Through Clear Dialogue and Problem-Solving Complementing counseling, practical communication strategies empower autistic adults and those around them to navigate conflicts more smoothly. A fundamental conflict-resolution framework includes: - Staying calm, regulating tone and body language, and taking breaks to avoid overwhelm. - Using “I” statements to express feelings and needs clearly, minimizing blame or accusation. - Summarizing and reflecting what others say to ensure accurate understanding. - Tackling one issue at a time to prevent piling up unresolved grievances. - Brainstorming solutions collaboratively and agreeing on concrete action plans. - Respecting processing time by pausing discussions and revisiting when both parties feel ready. Specific contexts benefit from tailored adaptations: In the workplace, autistic adults thrive when supervisors provide clear, written instructions, offer regular check-ins, and accommodate sensory needs by allowing quiet workspaces or breaks. Self-advocacy—like asking for written feedback or advance notice of changes—can prevent misunderstandings and build trust. Within family settings, establishing communication plans—such as scheduled times for difficult conversations and use of visual aids—helps prevent spontaneous, stressful interactions. Respecting sensory and personal spaces, along with openly explaining one’s processing style (e.g., “Silence means I’m thinking, not upset”), fosters empathy and smoother daily living. In romantic relationships, explicit communication about preferences is vital. Partners can benefit from scheduled debriefs after conflicts to check in emotionally and clarify misunderstandings. Concrete tools such as shared calendars, chore lists, or visual reminders support cooperation and reduce implicit assumptions about roles and needs. Enhancements such as preparing conversation scripts, explicitly naming emotions (“I feel frustrated because…”), and breaking down complex issues into smaller parts make dialogue more accessible and less intimidating. Visual supports, like shared “issues boards” or weekly check-in sheets, offer ongoing opportunities to express concerns constructively and reinforce positive changes. Building a Stronger Future Together Through combining neurodiversity-affirming counseling with practical, structured communication strategies, autistic adults gain tools to transform conflict from a source of stress into an opportunity for understanding and connection. These approaches nurture self-awareness, emotional regulation, and clear communication—empowering autistic adults to advocate for themselves and fostering stronger, more authentic relationships in all areas of life. For families, partners, and employers, adopting these strategies means recognizing and honoring neurodiverse communication styles, providing clarity and structure, and affirming strengths. With patience, respect, and collaboration, tensions become manageable challenges rather than recurring obstacles, enriching shared lives with trust, dignity, and belonging. A Call for Inclusive Systems and Future Directions Despite progress, systemic gaps persist in adult autism services globally, including in India. Transition planning must start early to bridge school and adult supports smoothly. Policy advocacy, community-based inclusive opportunities in education, employment, and housing, and increased adult diagnostic services are essential. Additionally, future research should center autistic voices to redefine success and well-being on their terms, further challenging stigma and expanding cultural awareness.",

      "content": "Parent Perspectives: Early Intervention The following are the perspectives gathered from parents of four children between the ages 5 to 8 years. All the children are in early intervention through ABA and/or Occupation Therapy (OT) and speech therapy. The children are not in formal school and the mothers typically spend their entire time taking care of the children. These perspectives were gathered through in-person interviews in August 2024. Profiles S-Am S is a housewife who loves spending time with children and cooking for them. She says she would think of dishes her children would like and try out new items all the time. As a mother of 2 children, her day usually goes by in taking care of and spending time with the children. Am is the 2nd child, currently 6 years old, loves to play and arrange things in a linear fashion. Am enjoys fruits, and food, especially spicy chicken. Am is taking ABA sessions for 2 hours a day. P-M P loves stitching and was doing it for a living until she got married. 2 children later, she has dedicated her time to taking care of them. M, the older son is 7 years old and was diagnosed when he was 3 years old. He would want a new toy everyday and the interest with a toy wouldn’t last for more than 10-15 minutes. He has always loved going to the park, and recently he has also started asking for going to the shop, understanding that we buy things from a shop. Now, he also senses that when the mother says she is going out, it means she won’t be there for sometime, so he asks to go along. M challenges everyone working with him with his head banging behavior. M takes ABA sessions along with OT currently. Y-An Y has a masters degree in Electronics and Communication and worked as a lecturer and HR consultant until she had a child. Y enjoys watching devotional material on her mobile when she is free. She is currently a housewife who is focusing on her children. Y and her 2 children relocated from Barcelona recently to seek ABA therapy for her 5 year old son, An. An is pre-verbal as of now and gets excited when he sees spinning objects. He also seems to enjoy traveling in any vehicle, and playing with water. An has just started ABA sessions and Y is looking forward to seeing how this pans out for An. J-S J completed her MA in history and B.ed. She is a government school teacher and has been on leave for the last 3 years to take care of children. Her 1st born, S who is 8 years old now, was diagnosed when he was around 3 years old. S says he loves reading books related to history and enjoys fine arts but there has not been any time for them recently. S is attending ABA sessions now for 1.5 years and J also actively participates in his sessions. S has started to communicate his feelings, started to know appropriate actions in appropriate places (for example, he knows park is for playing and temple is for praying.) S has also started to choose his dress and dress himself up. Recently he has also started to flush the toilet and clean his hands after that, all by himself. J was gleaming as she expressed all of this. They are also able to take him to functions and manage him. That way, there has been a lot of social learning in the last 1.5 years.",

Around 2 years of age, he stopped saying those words. He would also play by himself mostly. His grandfather visited that time and we all felt something was off. When he was 2 years and 5 months, we took him to the doctor as he was now also becoming more hyper. During the lockdown time, we also saw that he started lining up toys. It started with toys and it went on to anything and everything he could put his hand on. The doctor did some assessments and symptom checks and told us he has Autism. P-M M didn’t talk when he was 2 years old. When he was about 2.5 years old, there was an incident when he was at his grandparents place where he woke them up around 2-3am and started dancing on the bed. This happened once or twice. He got a fever when he was around 3 years old and while we took him to the doctor then, we expressed this concern and they suggested we take him for an assessment. We were told he has Autism and that there is no cure, but can be made manageable with therapy. He was 3 years old when he got diagnosed. Y-An No response to name call He liked to watch things that were spinning He would line up objects There was also no eye contact We took him to the physician in Barcelona when he was 2 years old and they suspected Global Developmental Disorder (GDD) and at 3.5 years old he was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum disorder Level II as per their classification system. J-S Till S was 1 year old, everything seemed very normal. We started noticing evident signs only after he was 2 years old. He was not pointing, no eye contact and he also didn't talk. When we noticed that he was not talking, we took him to the doctor. S was 2.5 years old by then. They saw him and said that it looks like symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder. We did not take that seriously and started school when S was 3 years old. After teachers there pointed out concerns, we again visited a psychologist for the 3rd time and got a detailed report on the diagnosis.",

      "content": "What were your feelings and thoughts before and immediately after the diagnosis? Was there a period of uncertainty? S-Am I didn’t understand what was going on. I had been believing that everything was normal. How could something be wrong now? I cried a lot. We did not understand and we were not satisfied either. So we wanted to get a 2nd opinion and went to NIMHANS. There they said symptoms are there but also told us not to worry and fear so much as he will be fine slowly. We were still confused. P-M I was so confused because we did not know the head or tail of Autism and no one gave us a clear picture. He was diagnosed at NIMHANS and they suggested we take their therapy that happens once in every 3 months, but no more information was given. Both my husband and I were very upset. I didn’t eat for about a week and kept crying. Then I had to tell myself that I need to be strong for my son and I have to change. Yet, for about a year things were uncertain as M was taking therapy only at NIMHANS once every 3 months and we did not know how to manage him nor did we see any improvements. I felt helpless as managing 2 children was difficult. My mother would come for 1 week or 2 and help out, but I had to run the show. Y-An After the possible GDD diagnosis when we went for review at 3.5 years, I kept praying that nothing should be wrong. After hearing the word, I cried in front of the doctor. There was fear of the future and it took me 2-3 months to accept the fact and now I am hopeful that there will be something that can be done to manage this. An was attending school back then and they were very supportive and caring. A special educator would come and teach him once or twice a week and ensure there is some learning happening. At 2 years when they said he might have GDD itself I started looking up and reading and enquiring about the various possibilities. So after the Autism diagnosis there was no period of uncertainty as such. J-S The term sounded like Greek and latin. We have never heard of this before. We were very worried. S was our first child. He was born 4 years after our marriage and through treatment. He was very precious to us. That 1 year after that was very difficult. S was getting more hyper and aggressive. I was still processing this. I used to get very irritated and show my frustration to my husband. My husband was in a better place due to the way he generally sees things and would say “This is not a problem we created for ourselves. This is God-given and there will also be a solution to this.” I also got pregnant with my 2nd child that year, so I had to take care of myself. Then I became calmer with the support of my family.",

We don’t know what is right and what is wrong yet. Some ask us to stop everything, some ask us to take ABA, Speech and OT. I am still confused if I am doing right by Am. So I can’t say if I actually have the knowledge I need to have. The resources I have collected so far are only through other parents. I am not experienced with technology also. Anything I need, I ask my older child and he looks for it and gives. P-M My knowledge has majorly been from Google. Even the current ABA center, SCA, I found out myself through google. At a rehab center M went to initially, they gave us some understanding, but Google has been helpful for me. Y-An My knowledge came from doctors, specialists and fellow parents. The most useful knowledge I have found so far is from fellow parents. Hearing their experiences of how they approached or what they did has helped me in shifting perspectives and taking decisions.

      "content": "What initial steps did you take after diagnosis? What were the alternatives you considered? How did it work out? S-Am One of the doctors suggested group therapy at a rehab center and we went ahead and enrolled him there. He went for group sessions for 1 year, but there were no changes. We consulted with the doctor again and he suggested we go for one to one sessions. When AM was 3.5 years old he started one to one sessions and would attend group sessions as well. They also recommended medication for him to sleep as he was not sleeping at all. We gave him the medication, but since I saw that he was not sleeping, I stopped it myself. The group and one to one sessions went on for a year but we were not satisfied as we were still confused. There was no clarity about why we are doing what we are doing. There was no transparency at the center also. When he was 4.5 years old we started ABA sessions. That is again from parents’ suggestions. In the last 1.5 years I have an idea and I am able to see what is being done to Am. We see that it is working too. Alternatives, we gave him homeopathy medicines for his sleep when he was 2.5 years old as suggested by a doctor. We stopped when he started to sleep at night. We didn’t want him to become dependent on medicines as Am loves medicines because of its sweet taste. In our house, we lock medicines in the locker like we lock up gold because of this. P-M We took the therapy they suggested at NIMHANS once every 3 months for half an hour each session. He was also given medicines for his hyperactiveness. We were not satisfied and on the lookout for help about knowing what is to be done. During one such instance when my husband who is working as a driver expressed our concern to one of the doctors he was driving for, they suggested a rehab center. There they started him on OT, ST and infant sessions. After 2-3 months speech therapy sessions stopped, and also he was doing well. So they suggested we take him to school now. At school they found him to be too hyper and having low sitting tolerance. Now we were looking for options that offered school and therapy and I understood we needed ABA for working on his sitting tolerance. When I was searching on these bases, the ABA Center SCA popped up. So we have started ABA here now. Y-An In the Spanish system, they don’t want to label or do any therapy until the child is above 3 years. So only after the diagnosis at 3.5 years, we started speech and OT where An would have 1 session of each every week. He attended this for about a year and when we came to India for vacation, we met a developmental pediatrician and from her suggestion to try ABA for a year or so, my children and I have moved to India now. Alternatives I didn’t consider as much as there are only so many options available back in Spain. They have sensory integration therapy, then there is speech and occupational therapy. We considered homeopathy after one of our relatives who is a homeopathic doctor suggested, but we are yet to discuss and take that forward. J-S Since we didn’t take it seriously the first time, we right away started S with school. After the 2nd consultation is when we started him on therapies. They suggested we take Speech, OT and Behavior therapy. We found a center closer to our house for behavior therapy and started therapy there. We found other places for Speech and OT too. We tried Homeopathy because my husband’s friend suggested for S’s aggressiveness. We stopped in a few months time as there were no changes. We also tried Ayurveda Panchakarma treatment for 8 months. We found that also useless. It was time consuming and also costly. We tried allopathy medicines for his behaviors. It showed results. That’s when we stopped Ayurveda. S was also attending school with a shadow teacher and a caretaker. After a teacher suggested this center for ABA, we have stayed here as we are seeing a lot of progress in S now. Editor's note: While some of the parents mention alternatives, we do not endorse any of them. Many of the alternatives that parents try are not evidence based. Some can be outright dangerous. Please see the guide section on caution about cures for a detailed discussion of alternative approaches and why one should be cautious about them.",

S-Am We have settled on ABA and OT for now. So far to figure things out and see what is working and not working itself took us some time. There has been so much confusion for us with regard to what to do. He is one person but there are so many different opinions. We are spending money and time and we expect it to be worth it. We have shelled out a lot of money so far and it has impacted our family that way. P-M Occupational therapy, Speech therapy and Applied Behavioral Analysis is what we settled on. I think they have all helped us in knowing how to manage him. We are in a better place from where we started. Y-An We settled on OT, Speech initially as he was not talking. Speech therapy was good there maybe but I don’t think it worked for An. We are taking ABA after the doctor’s suggestion in India now. That has definitely left an impact on the family. My husband is managing alone and the 3 of us are here at my parents’ place. It’s a lot of stress for the both of us as parents, but we have hope. Other than that I think as a family now we have become more understanding of each other and we see more positivity. My husband has become more patient now, I feel. An is more settled now because of the interventions we have done so far. An’s sister also shares a good bond with him and takes care of him whenever necessary. She was confused initially as to why An is behaving a certain way. But once we explained, she understood him. For her also, shifting to India was a major shift as the schooling systems are very different and she is getting accustomed. J-S After a point we felt like we were taking too many treatments and they were hard on our pockets too. So we stuck with Behavior therapy. S was 7 years old by then. After coming to the ABA center, we have been here for the past 1.5 years now. This is going well. S has become manageable and that is a huge blessing to our family. I feel hopeful as it looks like I am on the right path. Choosing the interventions What factors influenced you to settle on this early intervention? S-Am Some factors I took into consideration before settling on one are: If it’s working or not working Occupational therapy - we realized he requires to relax/ calm down physically due to his hyperactive nature Speech therapy - we took it because he wasn’t talking. ABA - doctor suggested that it will improve sitting tolerance and that it will prepare him for school. P-M Google knowledge. Whatever google suggested and I read, we took blindly. Y-An OT we had to take as he was hyperactive. Speech therapy, we took it because he wasn’t talking. ABA we are taking after the doctor's suggestion. Now I realize that for speech sessions to work, he should be having sitting tolerance and attention. J-S I came to each therapy through suggestions. What has helped me settle here is that I see progress and when I look back I see that the therapists work with dedication and the session timings are longer here. In most centers each session is only for 45 minutes and it goes in settling down itself. There is not much learning happening. How much my child is learning is also a factor I have looked into.",

P-M All of it put together did take a toll on us as it was only me and my husband taking care of two children, mostly me. It’s a little easier now as the younger child is going to school. I am able to manage M’s schedule better while he goes to school. Y-An At this point, I am not thinking about myself at all. My personal life is not in the radar. After my first kid itself priorities started to change and now after An, he is the first priority. For now here in India, I have my mother’s support. So a huge chunk of my responsibilities otherwise, household chores, is taken care of. My daughter has also started to manage herself. When An was born, she was already 8 years old, so managing 2 children has not been a problem for me. My husband is managing himself back in Spain.

      "resource": "Getting a Diagnosis",
      "resource_key": "getting-a-diagnosis",
      "content": "The importance of diagnosis One of the questions that parents usually have is about the need for diagnosis. Many times parents do not want to get a diagnosis for a variety of reasons. Some parents argue that diagnosis just attaches a label and they are not comfortable with the label. Some parents feel that the child does not need a label as long as he/she is able to ‘cope’ with autism. Many parents are weary of the negative social implications of acknowledging their child’s autism. So, why should one seek a diagnosis? The primary reason for either getting a diagnosis or not should be about the difference it makes to the child. When seen from that point of view, it seems to make more sense to get a diagnosis for the following reasons: + A diagnosis provides parents with accurate information about the various difficulties the child may have. This will help them get appropriate help. + A diagnosis helps get appropriate support for everyone, both the parents and the child + Without a diagnosis, the child grows up without support and accommodations. However, many people on the spectrum are aware that they do not ‘fit in’. This could result in feelings of alienation. Also, the effort needed to ‘fit in’ and cope is hard work. + In the absence of a diagnosis and an acknowledgement of their difficulties, children may be pushed to achieve goals that are set by the systems around them, instead of working on their specific difficulties. This may result in them growing up to be adolescents that have completed school and cleared exams but otherwise not functional for their age. + As the child grows up to be an adult, and social and emotional demands on them increase, they may not be able to cope. In the absence of a diagnosis, it may lead to feelings of inadequacy and can lead to depression and other mental health issues. + A diagnosis helps people make sense of who they are and their life experiences. When should parents go for screening and diagnosis? Naturally, parents routinely observe and assess their child's progress during the early years, a practice known as developmental monitoring. In this process, parents, family members, or caregivers closely follow a child's development in areas such as play, learning, speech, behavior, and physical movement. This vigilance allows them to gauge whether the child is reaching the typical developmental milestones and promptly detect any concerns that may arise. It's advisable to maintain regular communication with the child's primary physician regarding their developmental progress. Additionally, doctors routinely evaluate a child's development during their regular check-up visits. When there are concerns about the development of the child, parents should consult their primary care physician and they may be referred for further screening.",

      "content": "While there are no definite known causes of autism, the process of diagnosing it often requires the involvement of multiple professionals and various assessments. As a result, it may not be a straightforward procedure, but early diagnosis is crucial for both the child and their family to enhance their quality of life and meaningfully navigate the condition. Developmental Screening If any delays or concerns are observed, the next step is to undergo developmental screening, a more formal evaluation of a child's developmental progress. This screening process is conducted typically by a developmental pediatrician/ psychologist. It entails the use of structured questionnaires and checklists covering areas like language, physical abilities, cognitive skills, as well as behavioral and emotional aspects. In instances where there are concerns or if a child is at a higher risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), such as having a family member with ASD, additional screening may be recommended. It's worth noting that developmental screening can be conducted as a standard part of a child's regular health checkup, even if there are no apparent concerns.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends developmental and behavioral screening for all children during regular visits at the ages of 9 months 18 months and 30 months. In addition, AAP recommends that all children be screened specifically for ASD during regular visits at 18 months and 24 months. Screening Instruments Most often the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up (MCHAT - R/F) or the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used. + MCHAT{.external target=\"_blank\"} is a brief checklist of yes/no items for early detection among children 16 to 30 months of age. + Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) observes a child’s behavior and uses a 15-point scale to evaluate a child’s relationship to people, body use, adaptation to change, listening response, and verbal communication. A well-executed screening will determine whether a more comprehensive assessment for autism is required. Additionally, it aids in the identification or exclusion of any other potential issues or conditions that may be present. Screening outcomes and diagnosis Parental responses in the child's screening are highly significant. If all results are within normal parameters and parents have no concerns, that will conclude the process. However, if the child exhibits developmental challenges or if the doctor shares any concerns, they will direct the parents to a specialist for further evaluations, which may include tests to rule out other issues, such as speech-hearing impairment. Once other conditions are ruled out, and the child meets the ICD (International Classification of Diseases)- 10 or DSM - 5 (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder, the child will be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Next steps Based on the test results, the pediatrician may refer the parents for therapies (speech, behavioral, or occupational therapy). At this stage, it is vital that parents are taking informed decisions, understand the difficulties of their child and are aware and mindful of the choices they are making.",

      "content": "So your child is just diagnosed with autism. First, convince yourself of the diagnosis. Take a second opinion or third opinion as necessary. Meet other parents. This is because if you are unsure of the diagnosis, you will be unsure of what to do and that will waste time. Try and understand the rationale for the diagnosis and the recommendations. Second, recognise that you need help both in terms of expertise about autism and your own emotional health. You are most likely to be someone who does not know about autism. This diagnosis has come as a shock to you. You need help to make sense of it. Find support groups. Seek the help of experts, other parents, counsellors or family members. Remember that your child needs you in good shape. Then, recognise that the child needs help. A child with autism has a different neurology than you. She may have sensory experiences that are very overwhelming. She might be struggling with social situations, and may have communication problems. While it might be difficult for neurotypical people to imagine these problems and their severity, these difficulties are real. Traditional parenting approaches may actually make it more difficult for the child. Also, every person on the spectrum has slightly different difficulties and experiences life differently. It is important for you as a parent to learn more autism, how it is impacting your child and then help her. As you go ahead and make further decisions, remember that the objective is to help the child. The child needs help with sensory experiences, social issues and communication, at the very minimum. Every decision you make should be examined in the light of this question - how is this likely to help the child? Look for more information to make sense of autism and what your child is going through - If you are already on this resource page, you have made a start! Usually, the recommendation from developmental psychologists is to start therapies. Check the therapy centres around you. Examine their credentials and choose a good therapist. Here is a note on how to choose therapists. Once again, think about their recommendations and how they are going to help your child. While the therapies and the amount of help your child needs may look overwhelming at first, a lot can be done using common sense. Think of how you can skill yourself up. What can you do at your end? In the Indian context, most institutions that deal with children - preschools, schools, activity centres etc. - do not have much understanding of the needs of children on the spectrum. Remember that you cannot help other people working with the child unless you have a good sense of your child, her difficulties and how to respond to them. All of this is going to require your time. Plan such that you are able to spend time with the child, interface with therapists and gradually develop an understanding of how to help her manage her daily life. In summary, take care of yourself, understand your child and continue working. You can do this. A few key questions Here is a short note on a few key questions parents tend to have when their child is diagnosed. First is a set of questions like what caused my child’s autism, is it my fault etc. This [note] (https://disability.farmhill.in/disability-guides/autism/identification-causes.html#what-causes-autism) talks about causes of autism. Hopefully, it will answer some of your questions and set you on the path of action. Preschool versus therapies Another question is about preschool versus therapies. Parents usually think that the child needs to go to preschool. There is a belief that going to school and mingling with other children will help the child learn social and other skills. There is merit to this thought provided the child has the necessary skills and temperament. However, most of the children tend to need therapy help with basic social and communication aspects like greeting others, being around others, pointing to what they want, saying yes or no etc. Many children also tend to have sensory issues around sound, touch, smell, space etc. In such cases, it is a good idea to get help for the child and ensure she is comfortable in the preschool environment. Otherwise, just sending the child to school and bringing her back may not be helpful. Also, going to an environment which she does not feel comfortable in but is compelled to perform one way or the other can have long term negative consequences. School readiness Another area where parents tend to be anxious is the school readiness of the child. Most parents believe that going to school is a necessary part of a child’s life. So, when their three year old is diagnosed with autism, one of their goals is to equip the child with basic skills needed to go to a preschool or school. Some of these skills include basic rule following, sitting in one place, playing nicely, being social with other children, etc. Some parents also believe it is important for their children to learn academic skills like reciting the alphabet, a few rhymes etc. While going to school may help a child acquire a set of necessary skills, children on the spectrum often do not learn by imitating others. They need help with navigating day to day environments due to their sensory and communication challenges. Many children tend to engage in what we think of as inappropriate behaviours - screaming, biting, scratching, just following someone around, watching things go round and round, flapping, constantly humming, zoning out etc. These are all their responses to the difficulties they are facing. In such a scenario, it is more important to address the child’s primary difficulties and equip her with some basic skills before sending her to an environment like a preschool. In summary, once again, the answer to whether a child should go to preschool or learn to be school ready depends on the same question - is it good for this child? If the child is able to navigate the environment, then the answer is yes. Else, no.",

      "content": "Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurological condition typically identified in childhood, which may raise questions among adults about the possibility of developing autism later in life, particularly if they've observed symptoms resembling autism. Due to the basic nature of the disorder, it is not possible for adults to acquire autism. Autism arises from atypical brain development, and by adulthood, the foundational neurodevelopmental processes are already complete. Thus, it is impossible to develop autism later in life. However, autism symptoms can start to show up/ affect later in life and the diagnosis of Autism can happen late for some individuals due to a variety of reasons: + Masking and Camouflaging: Many individuals, especially those with higher-functioning forms of autism, may develop coping strategies to mask their autism traits and fit in socially. This masking can make it challenging for professionals to recognize the signs of autism. + Gender Differences: Autism is often underdiagnosed in girls and women, as the diagnostic criteria were historically based on male presentations. Girls with autism may exhibit different social and behavioral traits that are less recognizable as typical autism symptoms. + Mild or Subtle Symptoms: Some individuals with autism have milder or subtler symptoms that may not be as noticeable in childhood but become more apparent as social demands increase in adolescence or adulthood. + Co-occurring Conditions: Individuals with autism may have co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which can complicate the diagnostic process and delay recognition of autism. They are often secondary conditions that occur when the autism is left untreated. It takes a keen eye and specialist who is well-versed in the nuances of autism to identify autism symptoms in adults. + Late Recognition of Differences: Some families and individuals may not recognize autism traits until later in life, especially if they have limited exposure to autism or were unaware of the spectrum's diversity. + Change in Life Circumstances: Life transitions, such as moving to a new environment, starting a new job, or entering college, can highlight social and communication challenges, prompting individuals to seek assessment and diagnosis. + Access to Services: Limited access to healthcare or diagnostic services can delay the identification of autism. In some regions, diagnostic resources may be limited, leading to later diagnoses. + Stigma and Misunderstanding: Social stigma or misunderstanding of autism can deter individuals and families from seeking diagnosis or support until later in life. “He/she will start talking when she is 5 or 6 years old. Their uncle/dad also started talking late only. Let’s wait.” In most cases, it could be a combination of these reasons. The family is not aware of Autism and its symptoms, the child is bright academically and somehow manages to mask the symptoms. As Samriddhi Malhotra, an individual on the autism spectrum, diagnosed in her 30s, shares: “My family couldn’t understand this because I was considered academically bright. Because of these ‘odd’ behaviours, people would say things like ‘she’s so careless and haphazard’ or ‘she’s lazy’. As an adult, I wouldn’t always understand social cues, the dynamics in a friend circle and the subtext and subtleties of what people say. But, over the years, I learnt to master them almost like a science. Piecing it together logically, like, oh, this is what people mean when they say this or that, and I learnt to adapt.” Signs to look out for Symptoms of autism in adults closely resemble those in children, such as difficulties in social situations, obsessive interests, and strict adherence to routines. Key symptoms that are often observed in adults with autism include: + Difficulty understanding other people’s feelings or reactions + Social anxiety + Trouble making and keeping friends + Coming off as brutally honest and not realizing they’re offending others + Not being interested in others’ points of view or feelings + Difficulty expressing how they feel + Interpreting things very literally or in black and white + Stuck in having the same routine every day and being uncomfortable if it is interrupted or threatened to be changed Diagnostic tools Since symptoms are not very different from what we observe in a child, the diagnostic process would be more or less similar. In most cases of adolescents, it would be the school that first reports concerns and then with the help of a psychologist one may undergo the diagnostic process. In adults, it could pose some challenges because symptoms of other disorders could be overlapping with autism symptoms. Either ways, a combination of assessments and clinical judgements could be used to diagnose older people. Some tools are: + Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) - (ADOS; Lord, Rutter, DiLavore, Risi, 1999) The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is considered the 'gold standard' for assessing and diagnosing autism and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) in individuals of all ages, developmental stages, and language abilities. + Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) - (ADI-R; Couteur, Lord, Rutter, 2003) The Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) is a structured interview employed for the purpose of diagnosing autism, planning treatment strategies, and distinguishing autism from other developmental disorders. Receiving an autism diagnosis according to a recent study with 9 adults over the age of 50, was seen as a positive development that enabled them to redefine their sense of self and gain a deeper understanding of their unique requirements. Before the diagnosis of autism, they had undergone treatment for anxiety and depression. They also reported experiencing behaviors associated with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) during their childhood and often feeling isolated and aloof from others, growing up. Although most people feel relief, it may also be accompanied with a feeling of guilt or grief over their life thus far, for they have to redefine themselves and their lifestyle. Therefore, it could be helpful to continue receiving psychological support while processing the diagnosis for themselves.",

      "content": "Family and Friends Lesson Plans As children grow up they usually gravitate towards other children of similar age and these bonds become stronger around teenage. This is a well researched aspect of human development and it satisfies many of the secondary needs for a person like the need to belong, how well regarded a person is, builds their self esteem and confidence and aids further potential. When children are on the autism spectrum, we see that the younger children engage in parallel play. Their atypical communication is interpreted as indifference and not having connections. They may not have access to vocabulary and some of the ideas,aspects and layers of relationships. That could lead to certain socially inappropriate behaviors which alienate them further and cause distress to the autistic person as well as the people around. Learning to raise boundaries is important to have good relationships as well as self preservation. Therefore, this lesson becomes an essential element in emotional education. This set of lesson plans may be appropriate for children 6 years and above. The following learning outcomes are addressed: Booklet 1: - To identify family members, understand their roles and what we call them - Discriminate between family and non family members. Booklet 2: Revisit strangers and known people Booklet 3: - To understand the word ‘friendship’ and identify ‘friends' from 'known people’ - Discriminate between friends and family, understand why some are friends - Discriminate between friends and ‘known people’ and strangers Booklet 4: To identify all the things we do with friends Booklet 5: How to follow boundaries with friends and why Booklet 6: How to manage ourselves when we do not like some people Booklet 7: How to manage ourselves when we like some people, extend to how to be friends with anyone.

Things to be kept ready - Pictures of family members, teachers, neighbours, shopkeepers, maid, driver, vegetable shop keepers, barbers etc. The pictures of non-family members essentially can be the people whom they see on a regular basis but not family. - Print out of the family tree poster or a handmade template. - Pictures of collective family time doing different things together - Pictures of each family member doing something that signifies the role they play - If it is a child using Avaz, enter the tiles ‘Family’ and ‘Not family’ in the people folder. Keep a visual ready with the words ‘Family’ and ‘Not family’ written. Activities Activity 1 Use photo cards of family, teachers, neighbours, shopkeepers, etc. and sort into “Family” and “Not Family.” How to conduct the activity - Have two sorting trays labelled ‘Family’ and ‘Not Family’. The labels should be placed such that it is clearly visible. It can be place infront of the trays. - Give the children one picture at a time from a mix of family and non family. - Let them think about where the picture goes and place in the tray. - When they keep the picture in one of the piles ask them why they placed it there. ‘Because it’s family’ or ‘Because it’s not family’. Children can say their responses, use Avaz or point to the visual. It depends on the comfort of the child to whichever way he or she likes to respond. Circle Family Worksheets Use the following worksheets to reinforce the concepts covered in this activity. A tailor made picture worksheet can also be made on similar lines. The file also has a sheet with blank spaces where different pictures from the child’s life can be pasted and they can circle who their family is. {{}} Activity 2 Create a personal family tree poster with names How to conduct the activity - Paste pictures of mother, father, sibling and themselves in their scrap book or on a sheet. - If the children recognise and relate to grand parents, add them as well. Receptive Identification By roles: Have the children receptively identify all the family members by their roles as mother, father, sister, brother etc. Children can paste the role names below each picture. You ask ‘Show me …..’ and the children show their family members. By names: Have the children receptively identify all the family members by their actual names too. You can ask ‘Show me ‘their mother’s name’’ and they point to their mother. Expression Children can use Avaz or a common visual strip to point as answer to the questions. By roles: You can show a picture and ask ‘Who is this?’ The child can respond by saying,or through Avaz or point in the scrap book. By name: You can ask ‘What is your mother’s name?’ They can say, use Avaz or point in their scrap book Talk about family structure You can begin with the child’s name. Write it on the board or paper. Who is your father? Draw a line from the child’s name and write father and name. Who is your mother? Do the same as above. Then ask just like your have a father and mother, your father also has father and mother. Who is your mother’s father? If the children are familiar, write by what name they call them Who is your mother’s mother? Do the same as above. If the children are familiar with aunts and uncles, then introduce them as mother’s family tree and father’s family tree. Do not do everything in one day. Go one step at a time. Then continue with the father’s parents. Grandmother and grand father, their children and their children. Arrange it like a flow chart on the board. Then move on to worksheet to make their own family tree. Family Tree Worksheets Use the following worksheets to reinforce the concepts covered in this activity. {{}} Activity 3 Things that a family does together and for each other. How to conduct the activity - Collect pictures of what the child’s family does together. - Paste them in the scrap book and label them. - A help box can be provided describing each activity. The words can also be added in Avaz. - Suggestions for pictures to collect: Playing games, small fights, arguments, eat together, sleep in the same house, hug, take care of the sick, cooks for others, travel together etc. - Discussion points: Talk about all the fun things a family does together, ask the children what their favourite activity is and who they like to do it with. - List the family members, what each of them do in general - Collect pictures of what each of the family members do in general. - For example - Father - Appa/Nanna/Acha/Daddy: Goes to office / Teaches in school/ Works on laptop etc / takes us oout / buys things; Mother - Amma/ Mommy/ Mamma - Goes to office /cooks for us/ takes us out/ feeds me / plays with me; Brother /sister - Akka/ Anna / Thangi/Thambi - Goes to school/ Plays with me/ fights with me / studies with me /does (chores - any specific thing the child does); Me - Go to school / does (chores - any specific thing the child does) / plays some game / goes to (a specific class) Discussion - What does Appa do? - Go through the various pictures and label them. These can be put in Avaz so that children can answer. - The same list can be printed as word strips or made into word strips so that they can choose the correct one and paste below each picture. - Paste these in a scrap book. Describe each of these pictures with words. - The children can write the description below the pictures or paste word strips. Worksheets Use the scrap book as visual support to do the worksheets. An example worksheet is provided as guidance. {{}} Discussion points for worksheets - Ask leading questions for each of the items in the worksheet. Provide visual support - scrap book and Avaz so that children can respond. - Use the basic family chart worksheet as support for the matching worksheet - Use the matching worksheet as support for the missing items worksheet.",

      "content": "Objective Students will differentiate strangers from known people and discuss how to stay safe. Things to be Kept Ready - Pictures of known people (teacher, therapist, OT, speech therapist, games coach, dance class teacher, neighborhood shopkeeper, driver, maid) and strangers (delivery person, plumber, electrician). Use real photos from the child's life where possible. - Visual aids: Labels for \"Known People,\" \"Strangers,\" and optionally \"Family\" for three-category sorting. - Printed worksheets: Sorting people, safe/unsafe behaviors, yes/no actions, three-column pasting activity.The worksheets are given below on this page. - Word strips for actions with known people, strangers, and family (e.g., greet, smile, buy things, follow boundaries). - If using Avaz, add tiles for \"Known People,\" \"Strangers,\" \"Safe,\" \"Unsafe.\" - Props for role play (e.g., name tags for teacher vs. stranger). Activities Activity 1 Introduce the idea of known people and strangers and sort people How to conduct the activity - Explain: \"People I know are known people. People I don't know are strangers.\" - Use role play: Facilitator acts as teacher (\"You know me\"), then stranger (\"Am I a stranger?\"). - Show mixed picture cards one at a time. Students sort into \"Known People\" and \"Strangers\" trays. Ask: \"Why here? Because you know them or not?\" Respond verbally, via Avaz, or point to visuals. Activity 2 Extend to three categories How to conduct the activity - Extend to three categories : Add \"Family\" pictures from Booklet 1. Create a three-ring circle chart: Family – Known People – Strangers. - Sort them into 3 categories. - Reinforce the idea that Family - we live in the same space, Known people- people we see regularly, whom we know. Strangers - people we do not know. - Fill the three ring circle chart after the discussion. Use the example chart provided and help the children make one for themselves reflecting them,their family,known people and strangers. {{}} Activity 3 Actions with Each Group This activity is to distinguish and establish what we do with each group of people. How to conduct the activity - Provide word strips of actions (e.g., smile/greet/ask for help with known people; buy things/take deliveries with strangers; hug/play with family). - Students sort actions under each category on charts or scrapbooks. Discuss: \"We follow boundaries with everyone for safety.\" - Game 1: Role play scenarios: Neighbor (known), delivery person (stranger), classmate (known). This is played like passing the parcel. Make chits indicating various roles like neighbour, teacher, mother, friend. Each child picks a chit in their turn. They open and read it and act according to the role written in the chit. - Game 2: Find which one is it? Keep the visual ready with the three words. ‘Family, known people and strangers’. This is also played like passing the parcel. Make chits indicating various actions with do with different people. The children take turns, open the chit, read it and indicate whether we can do it with family, known people or stranger. {{}} Activity 4 Safe Behaviors Discussion How to conduct the activity - Ensure prior knowledge of safe and unsafe adult is activated. If not, you can go through the activities to talk about safe and unsafe behaviors and people. Use the following worksheets. {{}} - Ask: \"If a stranger talks to you, what do you do?\" \"What around safe/unsafe adults?\" \"What if you feel unsafe?\" - Connect to boundaries: Same rules for known people and strangers. Use scrapbook pictures labeled with actions. Worksheets Use the following worksheets to reinforce the concepts covered in this booklet. {{}}",

      "content": "Supporting Autistic Teenagers - A Guide to Caregivers Teen years (13-19 years) are a period of rapid growth, transition, and complexity for all young people. For autistic teens, this period brings unique challenges as physical changes, emotional development, and hormonal fluctuations interact with the distinctive ways autism shapes communication, social understanding, and processing. With thoughtful preparation and the right support, autistic teens can thrive and move toward greater wellbeing. How it looks like Many parents report a confusing shift when their autistic child reaches around 13 years old. \"He was fine until last year—in one year everything flipped,\" is something we hear often. What appears as sudden behavioral deterioration is actually the culmination of unmet developmental needs colliding with the intense biological and social changes of adolescence. This is not the child's fault, nor is it the parents' fault. It happens because the emotional, physical, and social needs of growing up were not fully supported before this challenging time began. Research shows that approximately 30% of autistic individuals experience marked decline in adaptive functioning during adolescence. The Lived Experience of Behavioral Changes{.unnumbered} Case Study 1: From Compliance to Crisis at school A 13-year-old who had previously managed school with shadow teacher support, sitting appropriately and participating in class activities, suddenly became completely non-compliant. The family found themselves considering relocating to access intensive behavioral therapy as aggression levels became unmanageable. What manifested as oppositional behavior was actually emotional dysregulation stemming from years of unaddressed developmental needs. Case Study 2: Therapists' Challenge Therapists working with autistic teens report significant difficulties in maintaining routine activities. Children who once moved willingly between spaces now resist transitions from classroom to outdoor areas due to lethargy and lack of physical engagement. Constant requests for food (\"lunch, lunch, lunch\") become overwhelming, and ignoring these requests often triggers aggressive responses. These behaviors reflect the intersection of hormonal changes, unmet sensory needs, and the absence of comprehensive developmental planning. Shift from Academic Focus to Emotional Survival{.unnumbered} Educational achievement often takes a back seat to emotional and developmental challenges. The convergence of factors contributing to emotional dysregulation, make it harder for autistic teens to remain engaged in traditional learning. When emotional needs go unaddressed from the pre-puberty stages, particularly the ability to identify, express, and manage feelings, teens may experience frequent meltdowns, increased anxiety, or emotional withdrawal because of the growing complexity of their internal experience. At the same time, they may face academic challenges during teen years due to the gaps in early learning. Until primary schooling, many autistic children excel academically due to their strengths in pattern recognition and rote memory. However, as content becomes more abstract, particularly in mathematics and science, those without strong conceptual foundations may begin to struggle. If left unaddressed, this can also lead to academic withdrawal and school refusal. Understanding the Underlying Mechanisms The hormonal surges of puberty, which cause emotional intensity in all teenagers, interact differently with autistic neurology. While neurotypical teens are often given understanding for \"moodiness,\" autistic teens face stricter expectations for compliance, leading to invalidation and increased psychological distress. This double standard intensifies the already complex experience of adolescent development. Emotional dysregulation during these years stems from the convergence of: - Hormonal changes affect mood, sleep, and energy. - Social demands increase, but skills may not have been taught in advance. - Sensory sensitivities become harder to manage under stress. - Academic work shifts toward abstract concepts that may not match the teen’s strengths. - Physical maturity outpaces emotional readiness, creating inner conflict.",

      "content": "The pre-teen years (9-12 years) represent a crucial window of opportunity for preparing autistic children for adolescence. During this period, children become increasingly aware of themselves and their differences from peers. Rather than waiting for difficulties to escalate during the teenage years, families and professionals can begin conversations that foster self-understanding, acceptance, and agency. Preparing children early — emotionally, socially, and academically — helps them enter adolescence with more resilience. Creating Neurodiversity-Affirming Self-Image Open, honest communication about neurodiversity helps children understand that their brains work differently - and that this is perfectly acceptable. Framing autism as a difference rather than a deficit is crucial. These early years are ideal for discussing strengths, interests, and support needs in ways that feel empowering and affirming. Preparing for Change Puberty brings physical, emotional, and social changes that can be especially confusing or distressing for autistic children if not discussed proactively. Early, gentle conversations about bodily changes, emotional shifts, and social expectations create a foundation for understanding and self-advocacy. Social skills development focus on understanding concepts like turn-taking, reading facial expressions, and recognizing when someone needs space through real-life examples, role-play, and observation. Rather than rigid social rules, the focus should be on understanding different types of relationships and appropriate boundaries in various contexts. Fostering Agency Children benefit from gradually being given more influence over daily decisions - what to wear, what to eat, how to spend free time. This builds agency and control, providing protection against anxiety and emotional dysregulation during the more turbulent teenage years. Supporting Emotional Regulation Emotional regulation develops through validating all feelings, modeling healthy coping strategies, and never punishing children for expressing distress. Building emotional vocabulary through words, pictures, or communication devices enables children to better manage emotions and ask for help when needed. Compliance to collaboration Around ages 9-10, some autistic children begin showing what others might call \"non-compliance\" - resistance to instructions or routines that don't feel right to them. The expectation that children must always comply can feel overwhelming and unfair, especially for autistic children who may need more control over their lives. Shifting away from strict compliance expectations and toward collaborative approaches works best when started before puberty begins. Redefining Educational Success Autistics may face academic challenges during teen years due to the gaps in early learning. During primary schooling, many autistic children excel academically, possibly due to their strengths in pattern recognition and rote memory. However, as content becomes more abstract, particularly in mathematics and science, those without strong conceptual foundations may begin to struggle. If left unaddressed, this can also lead to academic withdrawal and school refusal. We also need to relook at how we view success in education. Success in education for autistic teens must encompass more than academic progress. It should include emotional regulation, self-understanding, and the acquisition of practical life skills. Many teens perform well in structured tasks like memorization or pattern recognition yet struggle with the abstract thinking required in higher-level subjects. When adults respond only by increasing tutoring or academic pressure, teens may memorize without understanding, leading to boredom, frustration, and disengagement. Essential Components of Meaningful Education include: - Balance between academics and practical life skills - Recognition of individual learning styles and processing differences - Integration of emotional literacy into daily instruction - Flexible approaches that honor neurodivergent ways of learning - Focus on skills that contribute to future independence and confidence Supporting Educational Engagement{.unnumbered} To maintain motivation and relevance, education must balance traditional academics with practical, real-world competencies. Learning to budget money, prepare meals, maintain personal hygiene, or navigate public transportation often holds more long-term value than test scores. These skills contribute directly to future independence and self-confidence. Families remain essential advocates during this transition, regularly updating Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) to reflect changing needs, strengths, and interests. Educational systems must broaden their definition of success to include all forms of progress - academic, social, emotional, and functional - celebrating diverse achievements rather than only traditional academic milestones.",

      "content": "Communication often changes significantly during adolescence. Some autistic teens become more verbal, while others may increasingly rely on alternative methods such as writing, pictures, or communication devices. It's essential for adults to respect and support all forms of communication, recognizing that spoken words are just one valid method of expression. Alternative communication methods—including sign language, typing, or communication apps—are equally legitimate and should be actively encouraged. The focus should be on effective expression rather than forcing conformity to verbal communication expectations. Social Communication Challenges{.unnumbered} As teens grow, social situations become exponentially more complex. Most autistic adolescents need explicit support in understanding how to discuss feelings, develop friendships, and request help when needed. The unwritten rules of teenage social interaction often remain mysterious without direct instruction and practice. Many autistic teens begin \"masking\" their differences during adolescence—hiding their authentic selves to fit in with others. This can be exhausting and lead to significant stress, anxiety, and depression. Creating safe spaces where teens don't need to mask helps them feel more comfortable, accepted, and able to develop genuine relationships. Developing Self-Advocacy Skills{.unnumbered} Self-advocacy represents a critical skill for autistic teens. They should be encouraged to speak up about their needs, whether requesting sensory breaks, asking for support, or saying \"no\" to situations that cause discomfort. Including teens in meetings about their education, therapy, or healthcare helps them learn to make informed decisions about their lives. This process begins with the agency-building discussed earlier—recognizing and validating teens' choices in daily matters creates the foundation for more complex self-advocacy skills. Supporting Communication Development{.unnumbered} Family Support - Families can foster communication by making home a place where all feelings, expressions, and communication styles are welcomed and valued[attached_file:1]. This includes accepting non-verbal communication, supporting alternative communication methods, and avoiding pressure to \"act normal.\" School Support - Educational settings should respect different communication styles and provide necessary tools like AAC devices. Teachers and staff need training in recognizing and responding to various communication forms, not just traditional speech. * Community Understanding - Broader community education helps everyone learn to listen and respond to all forms of communication, creating more inclusive environments for autistic teens to practice and develop their skills.",

      "content": "Teen years bring intense emotions and new social challenges for all adolescents. For autistic teens, these feelings can be particularly overwhelming due to sensory sensitivities, difficulties interpreting social cues, and the intersection of hormonal changes with autistic neurology. As we look beyond school education and daily regulation, another layer becomes vital during the teenage years: how autistic teens process emotions and interact with others in moments of stress. Emotional regulation - learning to manage feelings like anger, sadness, or frustration in healthy ways - becomes a crucial skill that requires explicit teaching and ongoing support. This is where counseling, dialogue, and conflict resolution take center stage. These are not optional ‘extras’ but essential supports that help teens understand themselves, manage their relationships, and avoid crises. For caregivers, the focus is not only on guiding but on creating safe spaces where teens can practice these skills with trust and dignity. When approached early, these strategies ease the storm of adolescence and strengthen both resilience and connection. Distinguishing Emotional Distress from Sensory Overload{.unnumbered} It's essential to differentiate between emotional distress and sensory overload, as they require different responses. What might appear as an emotional meltdown could actually be a response to overwhelming sensory input from noise, lighting, textures, or social demands. Understanding this distinction helps parents and professionals provide appropriate support. Tools for Emotional Recognition - Emotion identification charts and visual supports - Sensory profiles to understand individual triggers - Apps and digital tools for tracking emotional patterns - Body awareness exercises to recognize physical signs of emotional changes Social Challenges and Relationship Building{.unnumbered} Social situations become increasingly complex during adolescence, with unwritten rules that can be difficult to navigate. Rather than forcing autistic teens into traditional group activities that may cause stress, it's often more effective to help them connect with others through shared interests and passions. Friendships that develop from common hobbies, special interests, or activities tend to be more comfortable and meaningful for autistic teens. These connections provide natural conversation topics and shared experiences that can form the foundation for deeper relationships. Developing Regulation Strategies{.unnumbered} Co-regulation and Self-regulation Adults can model and teach coping strategies such as deep breathing, taking sensory breaks, journaling, or engaging in calming activities. Co-regulation—helping teens calm down together—should always precede expectations for independent self-regulation. Personalized Support Plans{.unnumbered} Creating individualized plans for handling stress and establishing calm spaces at home and school can make significant differences in daily functioning. These might include: - Designated quiet spaces for sensory breaks - Predetermined signals for requesting help - Specific calming activities or objects - Clear routines for managing overwhelming situations - Having a psychologist familiar with autism connected to the teenager Environmental Modifications{.unnumbered} Rather than expecting teens to adapt to overwhelming environments, modifying spaces to be more sensory-friendly demonstrates respect for their neurological differences and supports better regulation. Supporting Social and Emotional Development{.unnumbered} Family Approaches{.unnumbered} Families should focus on validating all emotions while teaching healthy expression strategies. This includes accepting that meltdowns and emotional outbursts are forms of communication rather than behavioral problems requiring punishment. Creating spaces where the child feels safe to communicate are important. Families can also model healthy conflict resolution at home by respectfully handling disagreements that arise naturally in all relationships - showing that conflict is normal in all relationships, and can be solved without punishment or silence. For autistic teens, disagreements can quickly escalate into meltdowns or withdrawal. Teaching conflict resolution means breaking problems into steps: pausing to regulate emotions, naming the issue, listening to the other person, and working toward a fair solution. This skill reduces aggression, protects relationships, and gives teens a sense of agency. Building habit of healthy communication through dialogues{.unnumbered} Dialogue is more than talking—it’s about creating ongoing two-way communication where autistic teens feel safe to share their thoughts, even uncomfortable ones. It’s a space where all the parties get to speak and to be heard respectfully. Too often, communication breaks down because adults expect compliance instead of conversation. Dialogue in adolescence should include asking permission (“Can I share my idea?”), validating feelings (“I see you’re upset”), and encouraging expression even when it doesn’t come out neatly. Practicing dialogue with personalized ground rules for a dialogue at home sets the stage for better communication in friendships, classrooms, and eventually workplaces. Professional Support{.unnumbered} Parents can take professional help and create a space for their autistic teenager to take the professional help as well. Therapists and counselors can integrate emotional literacy into everyday interactions, helping teens develop vocabulary for feelings and strategies for managing intense emotions. The focus should be on building skills rather than eliminating natural emotional responses. Counseling during adolescence is not about “fixing” an autistic teen but about giving them a safe space to process emotions, worries, and identity. Puberty often brings new anxiety, questions about belonging, and struggles with self-esteem. A trained counselor—ideally one familiar with autism—can help teens build coping strategies for stress, practice emotional expression, and develop confidence in their voice. Counseling also supports families by creating structured ways to address ongoing challenges without every conversation at home turning into a battle. Community Understanding{.unnumbered} Society benefits from recognizing that meltdowns and emotional expressions are signs that support is needed, not indicators of poor behavior or parenting. This shift in perspective creates more supportive environments for autistic teens and their families.",

      "content": "As autistic teens navigate adolescence, relationships become increasingly important yet more challenging to understand. The desire for connection is universal, but autistic individuals may need explicit support in understanding different types of relationships, appropriate boundaries, and social expectations in various contexts. Research shows that most autistic individuals desire romantic and sexual relationships, yet they often feel their knowledge about relationships and sexuality is limited compared to their neurotypical peers. This knowledge gap, combined with challenges in reading social cues, can create vulnerability and confusion during an already complex developmental period. Building Relationship Foundations{.unnumbered} Understanding Different Relationship Types{.unnumbered} Teaching about various relationship categories - family, acquaintances, friends, teachers, peers, and potentially romantic interests - helps autistic teens understand different behavioral expectations and boundaries in each context. Visual tools like relationship circles or family trees can make these concepts more concrete and understandable. Developing Social Skills Through Shared Interests{.unnumbered} Rather than focusing on abstract social rules, connection often develops more naturally through shared passions and interests. When autistic teens connect with others over common hobbies, special interests, or activities, conversation flows more easily and relationships feel more authentic. Friendship as Foundation{.unnumbered} Before considering romantic relationships, strong friendships provide essential learning opportunities. Friendships teach important skills like trust, empathy, reciprocity, and communication - all crucial for successful romantic relationships. Encouraging teens to develop meaningful friendships creates a foundation for all future relationships. Navigating Dating and Romance{.unnumbered} Understanding Physical vs. Social Maturity{.unnumbered} Many autistic teens experience a disconnect between physical maturation and social-emotional development. They may feel physical attraction or romantic interest before developing the social competence necessary for successful dating relationships. Understanding this mismatch helps parents and teens set realistic expectations. Teaching Social Cues and Communication{.unnumbered} The social signals involved in dating and relationships can be complex, inconsistent, and subtle. For autistic teens who have difficulty reading and responding to social cues, this creates particular challenges. Direct communication strategies often work better than expecting teens to interpret subtle hints or nonverbal signals. Practical Dating Support{.unnumbered} - Role-playing common social scenarios - Teaching direct communication: \"What did you mean by that?\" or \"Would you prefer to text or talk on the phone?\" - Discussing online dating safety and authentic self-presentation - Understanding consent and appropriate physical boundaries - Learning to handle rejection gracefully Building Healthy Boundaries{.unnumbered} Physical and Personal Boundaries{.unnumbered} Teaching about personal space, appropriate touch, and physical boundaries becomes increasingly important during adolescence. Autistic teens may need explicit instruction about: - Different zones of personal space in various social contexts - Appropriate vs. inappropriate touch - Reading body language cues that indicate comfort or discomfort - Understanding that boundaries can differ between relationships and situations Emotional Boundaries{.unnumbered} Understanding emotional boundaries—knowing what information to share with whom, recognizing when others need space, and protecting one's own emotional wellbeing—requires ongoing instruction and support. These skills help prevent both overwhelming others and being overwhelmed by social demands. Supporting Relationship Development{.unnumbered} Family Support{.unnumbered} Parents can support relationship development by: - Discussing relationships openly and without judgment - Providing opportunities for social connection through shared interests - Teaching about consent, respect, and healthy relationship dynamics - Supporting their teen's authentic self rather than pressuring conformity to neurotypical relationship norms. Educational Support{.unnumbered} Schools and therapeutic programs should include relationship education as part of comprehensive support, addressing: - Social skills in natural contexts - Understanding different types of attraction and relationships - Safety in both online and offline interactions - Self-advocacy in relationships Community Resources{.unnumbered} Connecting autistic teens with neurodiversity-affirming communities, support groups, and mentorship opportunities provides models of healthy relationships and reduces isolation.",

      "content": "Sex education for autistic teens extends far beyond basic reproductive health - it encompasses safety, consent, boundaries, and healthy relationship dynamics. Research consistently shows that individuals with disabilities, including autism, face higher risks of sexual assault and abuse, making comprehensive sex education not just helpful but essential for protection. The complexity of social and sexual relationships requires explicit, concrete instruction that may not be necessary for neurotypical teens who learn through social osmosis. Autistic adolescents often need clear, direct teaching about concepts that others might pick up through peer interaction or media. Starting Early: Pre-Puberty Foundations{.unnumbered} Building Body Awareness and Boundaries (Ages 8-10){.unnumbered} Teaching about private and public boundaries should begin during pre-puberty and be reinforced around age 12. This includes: - Understanding which body parts are private - Knowing appropriate and inappropriate touch - Learning about consent in simple, concrete terms: \"People should ask before hugging you\" - Identifying safe vs. unsafe adults and situations - Understanding family relationships and appropriate boundaries within them Teaching Consent Fundamentals{.unnumbered} Consent education begins with basic permission-seeking in everyday interactions. Teaching children that others should ask before touching them (\"Can I give you a hug?\" \"May I touch your shoulder?\") builds foundational understanding of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Changes in My Body: Preparing for Puberty{.unnumbered} Early Body Education (Ages 11-12){.unnumbered} Teaching about physical changes should begin before they occur. Many autistic children experience bodily changes like erections or body hair or breast development or vaginal discharges without understanding what's happening, which can be confusing or even painful, leading to anxiety and agitation. Therefore it is important to normalise the physical changes that one would undergo as an adolescent before they start seeing visible changes in the body. Comprehensive Puberty Education would include: - Explaining physical changes in clear, concrete terms - Teaching about hormonal effects on mood and behavior - Providing information about menstruation, including practical management - Discussing normal sexual feelings and appropriate private behaviors - Creating understanding about timing and privacy for sexual behaviors Conversational Boundaries and Safety{.unnumbered} Teaching Communication Safety{.unnumbered} A critical aspect often overlooked is teaching appropriate conversations about bodies and sexuality. Case studies reveal dangerous situations where autistic children, learning about private body parts, began discussing them with inappropriate people like bus drivers or other adults, leading to abuse situations. Essential Communication Rules to be taught explicitly include: - Private body topics should only be discussed with parents, doctors, or designated trusted adults - Understanding what information is appropriate to share in different relationships - Learning to recognize when conversations make them uncomfortable - Knowing how and when to seek help from trusted adults Addressing Teenage Sexual Development{.unnumbered} Managing Sexual Feelings and Behaviors{.unnumbered} By ages 14-15, teens should understand how to manage sexual feelings appropriately. This includes: - Learning about masturbation as normal and private - Understanding appropriate times and places for private behaviors - Creating designated \"private time\" windows when needed - Balancing natural sexual development with social appropriateness Relationship and Dating Education can look like: - Understanding different types of attraction (romantic, sexual, or neither) - Learning about consent in romantic and sexual contexts - Recognizing the difference between healthy and unhealthy relationships - Understanding that not everyone wants romantic or sexual relationships, and that's perfectly acceptable Practical Implementation Strategies{.unnumbered} Using Visual Supports and Social Stories{.unnumbered} - Creating visual materials to explain body changes and social expectations - Developing social stories about appropriate behavior in different settings - Using clear, concrete language rather than euphemisms or abstract concepts - Providing repeated teaching opportunities as understanding develops. Family Collaboration{.unnumbered} Sex education works best when families and professionals collaborate closely. Parents need support in having these conversations, and professionals need family input to make education relevant and culturally appropriate. Ongoing Safety Education{.unnumbered} - Teaching about online safety and appropriate digital interactions - Discussing the risks and benefits of social media and dating apps - Providing clear information about legal issues related to sexuality - Creating ongoing opportunities for questions and clarification Supporting Identity Development{.unnumbered} Many autistic teens explore their gender, sexual, or cultural identity during adolescence. Research indicates that autistic individuals may be more likely to identify as LGBTQ+ than their neurotypical peers. Sex education should be inclusive and affirming of all identities, providing information about: - Different sexual orientations and gender identities - Resources for LGBTQ+ autistic youth - Understanding that identity development is a process - Finding supportive communities and mentorship Creating Safe Spaces for Questions{.unnumbered} Establishing environments where autistic teens can ask questions without judgment, access accurate information, and explore their developing identity safely is crucial for healthy development. This might include connecting with other autistic adults, joining supportive communities, or working with affirming counselors or therapists.",

      "content": "Mental health concerns are common in autistic teens and often intensify during puberty when emotional dysregulation can become overwhelming. When parents feel overwhelmed by persistent meltdowns, aggression, or other challenging behaviors, and other supports seem insufficient, medication is often considered. This can occur in children as young as 12 years old for severe emotional distress or co-occurring conditions such as eating difficulties, severe anxiety, or persistent behavioral challenges. The Concept of \"Double Dosing\"{.unnumbered} A significant concern arises when medication is used to address challenges that stem from unmet developmental needs rather than genuine neurochemical imbalances. This phenomenon, called \"double dosing,\" occurs when natural emotional responses are medicated away instead of being understood and supported through appropriate interventions. If emotional dysregulation stems from lack of appropriate emotional education, communication development, or opportunities for agency, then medication risks masking distress without resolving root causes. The most concerning scenario is when medication becomes a substitute for foundational skill-building that should have begun earlier. Approaching Medication Thoughtfully{.unnumbered} Use Medication as Part of a Holistic Plan Medication should never be the first or only response to behavioral challenges. A thoughtful approach includes: - Prioritizing emotional regulation support from an early age (ideally starting around five) - Building communication skills so teens can express needs and exercise choice - Including teens in decisions about their care to foster agency and self-advocacy Address Underlying Needs, Not Just Symptoms The need for medication often reflects gaps in emotional support, communication development, and opportunities for meaningful choice-making. Proactive approaches that address these areas can reduce reliance on medication. Monitor and Review Regularly - Medication should be prescribed and monitored by healthcare providers experienced in autism and adolescent mental health - Regular follow-ups assess benefits, side effects, and changing needs - Plans should remain flexible and responsive to the teen's development Foster Communication and Independence Daily conversations and involvement in decision-making help prevent accumulated frustration and behavioral challenges. Gradually shifting from making all decisions for teens to including them in choices about school, therapy, and daily routines supports emotional regulation and reduces the likelihood of crisis situations. Medication and Conditional Independence{.unnumbered} From a neurodiversity-affirming perspective, teenagers can be considered independent even when their functioning is supported by medication—as long as their voice and choices remain central. Independence becomes conditional, supported, and negotiated rather than absolute, but it remains equally valid and respectful of autistic lived experience. The key question is not whether medication eliminates independence but whether it creates space for the teen to operate with greater agency and engagement in their life.",

      "content": "Beyond the Myth of \"Doing It All Alone\"{.unnumbered} Society often defines independence as complete self-sufficiency - \"doing it all alone.\" This narrow view creates exclusion for autistic individuals who may always need certain support, whether emotional, sensory, or social. Rather than viewing autistic teenagers as either \"dependent\" or \"independent,\" it's more accurate to picture independence as a spectrum of support. One teen might handle academics easily but need regular emotional support. Another might thrive in self-care yet struggle with abstract thinking. Some may succeed in supported employment while building fulfilling lives through various paths. A neurodiversity-affirming approach recognizes that true independence is not about eliminating support but about maintaining dignity, decision-making power, and control over one's life while accessing necessary assistance. The Autistic Perspective: Independence as \"The Ability to Take Help\"{.unnumbered} Autistic adults have offered a powerful reframing of independence: it's not about eliminating support but about being able to ask for and accept help without losing dignity or control. In practical terms, this might mean an autistic teen calling on a trusted adult during a meltdown, seeking support during confusing social situations, or using tools like sensory aids or communication devices to self-regulate. These actions demonstrate resilience and self-awareness rather than dependence. They show that a young person understands their needs and can identify when they require assistance. Far from diminishing independence, this capacity to negotiate support represents a deeper form of agency. Agency Exists Before Absolute Autonomy{.unnumbered} A common misconception is that autistic individuals must achieve complete autonomy before their agency can be recognized. This denies teenagers the right to have their choices respected while they're still developing. Yet teenagers demonstrate agency in many everyday ways: refusing disliked foods, choosing between activities, asking for help during distress, or expressing discomfort. Each of these represents an act of agency. When adults dismiss these expressions as stubbornness or immaturity, teens receive the damaging message that their voice only matters once they become \"fully independent\" in neurotypical terms. Conclusion: A Holistic Approach to Supporting Autistic Teens The teenage years in autism demand a fundamental shift from deficit-focused interventions to strengths-based, holistic support that honors the authentic autistic experience. The challenges faced during adolescence—from behavioral changes and educational struggles to developing independence and navigating relationships—are not individual failures but signals that our support systems need to evolve. Success in supporting autistic teenagers requires: Early and Ongoing Preparation: Starting conversations and skill-building in pre-puberty (ages 9-10) creates foundations that can weather the storms of adolescence. This includes emotional literacy, boundary education, self-advocacy skills, and comprehensive understanding of physical and social changes. Redefining Independence: Moving beyond neurotypical definitions of independence as \"doing everything alone\" to embrace supported autonomy where teens can access help while maintaining agency and dignity. True independence is the ability to negotiate support while retaining control over one's life. Thoughtful Intervention: Whether considering medication, educational modifications, or therapeutic support, interventions should address underlying needs rather than simply managing symptoms. The goal is creating space for authentic engagement rather than compliance with neurotypical expectations. Comprehensive Education: Recognizing that education encompasses not just academics but emotional regulation, life skills, relationships, and sexuality. Success is measured not only in grades but in self-understanding, meaningful connections, and preparation for fulfilling adult life. * Family and Community Partnership: Creating networks of support that extend beyond the family to include affirming educational settings, therapeutic relationships, and broader community acceptance. This includes connecting teens with neurodivergent adults and communities that model successful autistic lives. The ultimate goal is not to make autistic teenagers appear \"normal\" but to support them in developing into confident, self-aware adults who can navigate the world on their own terms while accessing the support they need to thrive. When we approach the teenage years with this understanding, we honor both the challenges and the incredible potential of autistic young people, setting the stage for meaningful, authentic adult lives. By recognizing that the difficulties of autistic adolescence often stem from unmet needs rather than inherent deficits, we can shift from crisis management to proactive support, from compliance-focused interventions to agency-building approaches, and from isolated individual treatment to comprehensive community understanding. This transformation benefits not only autistic teens and their families but enriches our entire understanding of human neurodiversity and potential.",

      "content": "The importance of a histroy of autism Why is the history of autism important? Why is the history of any scientific idea important, for that matter? The history of a scientific idea is important because science develops in the context of the challenges faced in a particular time and place. People who are doing science do not work in a vacuum, so what they notice and the way they interpret what they see, both depend on the context in which they are operating. However, when these interpretations become part of the science, they are sometimes seen to be somehow ‘objective’ by later day practitioners and students. This leads to a loss of context and inhibits the ability to critically examine older ideas, thereby giving them a longer life than they deserve. ::: {.callout-tip} Video Available This TED Talk by Steve Silberman covers some key points in the history of autism. ::: Nowhere is this more visible than in the case of autism. The acknowledged pioneer of autism research in the US was also the proponent of the claim that ‘refrigerator mothers’ caused autism. He focused on one specific end of the autism spectrum, ended up conveying the idea that it is a severely disabling, rare condition, and that led to a certain stigma around autism. Another pioneer of autism, while he had a better understanding of the variety of autistic traits, had to focus on the ‘higher functioning’ end of the spectrum, as he worked in the Nazi regime that did not have a place for the ‘feeble minded’. While both are Germanic, they wrote in two different languages making it difficult to reconcile these two ideas. Both failed to acknowledge the work of brilliant clinicians, who, incidentally, worked with one first and then with the other. Both might also have known about but ignored the seminal contributions of a Soviet Jewish woman psychologist, possibly due to antisemitism, sexist attitudes, and anti-Soviet sentiments. These contributions, if accounted for properly, would have made autism what it is today, but much earlier and with much less misery all around. Coming a little later, a parent of an autistic child, who worked tirelessly to disprove ‘refrigerator mother’ theory was also a supporter of controversial programs and alternative treatments like chelation, use of aversive and believed in the vaccine-autism link which was later discredited. Then it took a British woman psychiatrist, also the mother of a severely autistic child, to bring these accounts together and help us see autism for the spectrum it is. It took the accounts of a few autistic adults like Temple Grandin and Judy Singer, movies like Rainman, the recent tireless work of journalists like Steve Silberman, as well as countless others, to put the idea of neurodiversity as the basis of looking at and understanding autism, as we do today. So, yes, the history of autism is interesting and informative. Let's dive in for more detail!",

      "content": "Kanner's perspective on autism, as an infrequent and narrowly defined condition, influenced perceptions for years, contributing to precise diagnosis but potentially hindering a broader understanding of the spectrum. Our understanding of autism has undergone significant evolution, shaped by both early observations and subsequent scientific advancements. Initially, the term \"autism\" was coined by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1908, describing symptoms observed in schizophrenia as a withdrawal into an inner world or self-absorption. Leo Kanner, born in Austria in 1894, later became a key figure in defining and shaping the early understanding of autism. Leo Kanner – Psychogenic theories - 1941 Leo Kanner, who earned his MD degree in Berlin, moved to the United States, and embarked on a career in psychiatry. His influential work began in 1928 when he underwent psychiatric training and eventually joined John Hopkins University Hospital. Kanner's contributions included establishing a child psychiatric unit, transforming the doctor-patient relationship perspective. In 1935, he authored \"Child Psychiatry,\" the first English-language textbook on the subject. During this time, he helped clinicians Anne Weiss and George Frankl to escape the Nazi regime in Germany. Frankl later joined Kanner at John Hopkins University. In 1941, Kanner presented a paper titled \"Autistic Disturbances with Affective Contact,\" which was eventually published in 1943. This seminal work outlined observations of 11 children with common signs, including social isolation, a desire for sameness, routine obsession, delayed echolalia, and splinter memory skills. Kanner's perspective on autism, as an infrequent and narrowly defined condition, influenced perceptions for years, contributing to precise diagnosis but potentially hindering a broader understanding of the spectrum. Kanner proposed the concept of emotionally neglectful mothers (refrigerator mothers) in his observations of parents of children with autism. He suggested that cold and neglectful mothers might contribute to the development of autism in their children. Bernard Rimland – Autism as a neurological condition - 1964 It wasn't until Bernard Rimland challenged this hypothesis in 1964, advocating for a more biological and neurological understanding of autism in his book \"Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior,\" that a shift occurred in the scientific community's perspective. Rimland's work played a significant role in steering away from psychogenic theories and toward a more comprehensive understanding of autism as a neurological condition. Behavioral Approaches – Foundations of ABA Grounded in empirical research, ABA is a data driven method relying on collection and analysis of objective data to analyze the effectiveness of behavior interventions. It has evolved into one of the evidence-based approaches to working with autism. As psychogenic theories were shifting with Bernard Rimland advocating for a more biological understanding, Dr. Ivar Lovaas played a pivotal role in developing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). Lovaas utilized behavior modification techniques to address language and communication challenges in young children with autism, employing principles of operant conditioning and reinforcement to encourage desired language behaviors. Ivar Lovaas – Applied Behavior Analysis - 1965 In 1965, Lovaas published a groundbreaking study, \"A Stereotypic Language in Young Children,\" focusing on behavior modification techniques for language deficits in children with autism. Emphasizing individualized treatment plans, he recognized the diversity of autism and stressed tailored interventions based on each child's specific needs. Lovaas highlighted the importance of early intervention, acknowledging that addressing language deficits during early development could positively impact overall communication abilities in children with autism. His study employed a data-driven approach, prioritizing the collection and analysis of objective data to evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral interventions. This commitment to empirical research became foundational to the scientific approach characteristic of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), which Lovaas and his colleagues further developed in the 1980s. While the 1965 study focused on language development, it set the stage for Lovaas's comprehensive approach to autism treatment. Continuing his research and developing the Lovaas Method in the 1980s, he contributed to establishing ABA as a prominent, evidence-based intervention for individuals with autism. ABA involves breaking down complex behaviors into smaller components and using reinforcement strategies to encourage desired behaviors while discouraging undesirable ones. The Lovaas Method features intensive one-on-one behavioral therapy, often exceeding 40 hours per week, with a focus on structured learning, positive reinforcement, and individualized goals. Grounded in empirical research, Lovaas's work, including the 1987 study \"Behavioral treatment and normal educational and intellectual functioning in young autistic children,\" played a crucial role in establishing ABA as a leading intervention for autism. Study of autism in twins – Investigating genetic origins - 1977 The study's significance lies in shifting the perception of autism from an environmentally caused disorder to one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders. A few years down the line, despite Bernard Rimland's efforts to challenge the refrigerator mother theory, the concept resurfaced in 1967, perpetuated by Bruno Bettelheim, a psychoanalyst who echoed and popularized the theory in his book titled \"The Empty Fortress.\" A significant turning point came with the first-ever study of twins and autism in the history of autism research, providing an alternative perspective to blaming parents. Previous studies had noted a lack of resemblance for non-twin siblings, challenging the consideration of genetic influence on autism. The rarity of autism diagnoses at the time (2-4 children out of 10,000) contributed to the low rates observed in siblings, even if heritability were high. The groundbreaking study{.external target=\"_blank\"} conducted by Susan Folstein and Michael Rutter focused on 21 pairs of British twins, examining the concordance rates for autism. They studied identical twins (monozygotic), where a fertilized egg splits and develops into two babies with the same genetic information, as well as non-identical twins (fraternal or dizygotic) where two eggs are fertilized by two sperm and produce two genetically unique children. Among the 10 pairs of fraternal (dizygotic, DZ) twins, where at least one twin was diagnosed with autism using strict criteria, not a single co-twin was diagnosed with autism, indicating zero concordance for fraternal twin pairs. The most striking result emerged from the 11 pairs of identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins, genetically identical as clones. Among these pairs, 4 (36%) were concordant for strictly diagnosed autism. The researchers used case histories from interviews with parents and observations of the 42 children, maintaining blindness to whether the children were members of identical or fraternal twin pairs. The study's significance lies in shifting the perception of autism from an environmentally caused disorder to one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders. As molecular genetic research advanced in the 1980s, autism became a prominent target. However, Folstein and Rutter anticipated that genetic influence on autism might result from multiple genes of small effect size, explaining the challenges in identifying specific genetic culprits. The 1977 paper not only contributed to understanding the heritability of autism but also made additional discoveries that continue to shape the research agenda for autism, particularly in refining the diagnosis of autism. Autism Appears in DSM III - 1980 Following the increased recognition and understanding of autism, Autism made its way to the DSM-III (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition) as an independent diagnosis. This marked a significant step in acknowledging and categorizing autism spectrum disorders within the psychiatric diagnostic framework.",

      "content": "Lorna Wing proposed the concept of the \"autism spectrum.\" She emphasized that autism is a spectrum of disorders with a wide range of presentations, including different degrees of severity and a diverse set of characteristics. Her work has had a lasting impact on autism research, diagnosis, and support systems. Dr. Lorna Wing (1928-2014) trained as a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry. She and her husband John Wing both specialized as psychiatrists. They had a daughter Susie in 1956. Susie was delayed in development and had a ‘detached, insular’ manner. Despite being specialists in psychiatry, it took them years to get a diagnosis of autism. Convinced of the need for more research in the space, Dr. Wing changed her focus to child psychiatry. Dr. Wing and her collaborator Dr. Judith Gold did pioneer work in the field of autism. They initiated Camberwell Case register to record all patients using psychiatric services in that area of London and relentlessly accumulated case data that formed the basis of the influential insight that autism formed a spectrum. In 1981, she published a paper titled ‘Asperger syndrome: A clinical account’, popularizing the research of Hans Asperger. Asperger was an Austrian psychiatrist who, in 1940s, described a form of autism in a group of intelligent boys who were intensely interested in one or two subjects like dinosaurs or trains. They shared many of the usual problems associated with autism like the inability to make friends, repetitive behaviors, and distress at any change in routines. Dr. Wing presented Asperger’s paper, along with her own research, as strong evidence for her larger argument that autism should be understood as a spectrum of disorders sharing common roots. At one end are some who, like Dr. Asperger’s patients, would go on to successful careers and untroubled lives, at the other end, may be patients like those studied by Dr. Kanner. Who was Hans Asperger and how did his research not see the light of day till 1980s, while stigmatizing ideas of autism were around for about 40 years? Hans Asperger – the other end – 1944 Hans Asperger (1906-1980), an Austrian pediatrician born in Vienna. He pursued medicine and received his medical degree in 1931 from the University of Vienna. He joined the University Children's Clinic in Vienna. His mentor and supervisor at the clinic for the most part was Franz Hamburger, a prominent Austrian pediatrician. Under Hamburger's guidance, Asperger had the opportunity to observe and work with a diverse range of pediatric cases. Asperger's work on autism was influenced not only by his medical training but also by the clinical experiences and mentorship he received during his tenure at the University Children's Clinic. His colleagues had a unique way of treating children with special needs and they tried to adopt new ways of teaching and learning for those children. The collaboration between Asperger and Hamburger thus played a crucial role in shaping Asperger's understanding of child development and psychopathology, contributing to the pioneering observations that would later define his work on autism. During his tenure at the Children's Clinic in Vienna, Asperger extensively studied over 200 children. These children displayed a range of symptoms, from prodigious abilities coupled with struggles in school to more severe disabilities that led to institutionalization. Despite the diversity, they all shared common features such as precocious talents, social awkwardness, and an intense focus on laws, rules, and schedules. In 1944, Hans Asperger published a groundbreaking paper titled \"Die 'Autistischen Psychopathen’ im Kindesalter\" (\"The 'Autistic Psychopaths' in Childhood\"). This seminal work detailed his observations and conceptualization of a distinctive set of behaviors displayed by certain children, which are now recognized as falling within the autism spectrum. Asperger adopted a holistic understanding, viewing autism as a variation in neurodevelopment rather than a disorder. Crucially, Asperger recognized that these symptoms existed on a continuum, affecting both children and adults. He also keenly noted that the symptoms were noticeable in children only when they were 2 years old or older. Additionally, his work acknowledged the lifelong implications of autism but also expressed optimism about individuals leading fulfilling lives with appropriate support. When Asperger eventually shared his research with the world, he chose to highlight his higher-functioning patients. This decision was influenced by the era he lived in, marked by the Nazis' pursuit of purifying the land of the \"feebleminded,\" leading to the euthanization of many institutionalized children. Consequently, Asperger unintentionally conveyed the impression that autism was a rare condition affecting young geniuses, rather than the more common syndrome he had identified. However, despite its significance, the paper did not gain widespread recognition initially, due to the language barrier and the second world war. The mystery of Asperger – Kanner Connection Psychiatrist George Frankl was working at the Vienna clinic much before Asperger joined there. Psychologist Anne Weiss was also a part of the staff at the clinic. Both published papers in 1934-35, which included descriptions of children who had same characteristics as autism. They were working closely with Asperger. Both were jews, and they escaped the Nazi regime in 1935-37. Asperger was named the head of the clinic in 1935. Frankl and Weiss, who later married each other went to work with Leo Kanner in 1938. Kanner’s paper titled \"Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact\" was published in August 1941. Asperger’s paper, which Lorna Wing translated in 1981, was first submitted as a postdoctoral thesis in 1942 and was published in 1944. It is difficult to imagine Kanner was unaware of Asperger’s work, while definitive evidence is not available. One can only wonder what would have happened if they acknowledged each other’s work and collaborated.",

      "content": "In 1998, a paper in Lancet claimed that there is a connection between Autism and the MMR vaccine. While the study was later found to be fraudulent and was retracted, the questions about vaccine safety and impact on autism refuse to leave the public perception. Another detour in the journey of understanding autism was driven by Andrew Wakefield, a British gastroenterologist. Wakefield had been involved in researching gastrointestinal symptoms in children with developmental disorders, particularly those with autism. He had observed certain gastrointestinal issues in some of these children. Wakefield became increasingly concerned about the MMR vaccine, which is administered to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella. He questioned the safety of the vaccine and its potential association with developmental disorders, particularly autism. In 1998, Wakefield and his colleagues published a study in the medical journal The Lancet, claiming to have found a link between the MMR vaccine, bowel disease, and autism in a small group of children. The study, based on a case series of 12 patients, suggested a temporal association between MMR vaccination, gastrointestinal symptoms, and the onset of developmental regression. The study faced immediate criticism for its small and selective sample, lack of a control group, and methodological flaws. Moreover, ethical concerns were raised about undisclosed financial conflicts of interest. Wakefield had financial interests in pursuing research that could potentially link the MMR vaccine to developmental disorders. He was involved in a business venture to develop diagnostic tests for inflammatory bowel disease, and a vaccine scare could potentially benefit his business interests. The study was eventually retracted by The Lancet in 2010 due to ethical concerns and the discovery of undisclosed financial conflicts of interest. Wakefield lost his medical license in the same year, facing disciplinary action for ethical violations. The Wakefield study had a profound impact on public perception and contributed to vaccine hesitancy. However, it has been widely discredited by subsequent research, and Wakefield's actions have been condemned by the scientific community for their ethical and methodological shortcomings.",

      "content": "Building on the work of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger, Lorna Wing proposed the concept of the \"autism spectrum.\" She emphasized that autism is a spectrum of disorders with a wide range of presentations, including different degrees of severity and a diverse set of characteristics. Adding on, Wing also introduced the concept of the \"triad of impairments\" to describe the core features of autism. This triad includes difficulties in social interaction, communication, and imagination (often manifested as repetitive and stereotyped behaviors). The triad of impairments became a foundational framework for understanding and diagnosing autism spectrum disorders. Along with Judith Gould, she also developed the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI), a structured interview for parents or caregivers of individuals with autism. The ADI became an essential tool for clinicians and researchers in diagnosing autism and gathering information about a person's behavior and development. Wing, apart from actively being involved in advocating for individuals with autism and their families, contributed to better recognition and understanding of autism in girls and women by highlighting the underrepresentation of females on the autism spectrum. Her work drew attention to the fact that autism might present differently in females compared to males. Her work has had a lasting impact on autism research, diagnosis, and support systems. Autism in Adults – Temple Grandin – 1986 As one of the first adults to break the stigma and publicly disclose her autism, Temple Grandin made enormous contributions to the field of autism by drawing attention to the lived experience of autistics. Temple Grandin (1947-) was born in Boston into a wealthy family. She was among the first adults to publicly disclose she was autistic, in her 1986 book ‘Emergence: labelled autistic.’ Born at a time when children like her were routinely institutionalized, Temple was supported by her mother and developed into the autistic savant as she is recognized today. Her book was based on experiences of an autistic, rooted in her personal experiences, observations, and advocacy. Grandin has provided invaluable insights into the lived experience of autism. Her book \"Thinking in Pictures,\" offers a first-person account of the sensory experiences, challenges, and strengths associated with autism. Grandin's unique cognitive style, characterized by visual thinking, has been a focal point of her contributions. She coined the term \"thinking in pictures\" to describe her thought processes, emphasizing the importance of visual cognition in understanding the world. This perspective has influenced how educators and researchers approach autism, and Grandin's insights have extended to recommendations for creating sensory-friendly environments that support individuals with autism. Her suggestions for adapting educational settings and incorporating sensory considerations have played a role in shaping the design of spaces to meet the needs of individuals on the autism spectrum. Beyond her literary contributions, Temple Grandin's professional endeavors in animal science and her innovative designs for livestock handling facilities reflect her understanding of sensory sensitivities, a common trait in individuals with autism. Her work in enhancing animal welfare demonstrates her ability to apply a unique perspective to real-world challenges. In addition to her autobiographical writings, Grandin has authored numerous books and articles on autism, animal behavior, and related subjects, contributing to the widespread knowledge about autism in both academic and popular contexts. Stories of Grandin and other adult autistics like her, and the 1988 movie Rainman, also gave rise to the idea that autistics are unusually good at arts or math – a condition called savant syndrome. Emergence of neurodiversity paradigm-1990s Neurodiversity describes the idea that people experience and interact with the world around them in many different ways; there is no one \"right\" way of thinking, learning, and behaving, and differences are not viewed as deficits. Lorna Wing and Temple Grandin changed how people think about autism. They showed that autism is different for each person. Earlier, people thought of autism as the same for everyone. Wing created the idea of the \"autism spectrum,\" and Grandin talked about the strengths of people with autism. This changed how society saw disabilities. People started thinking about how society makes it hard for people with disabilities. This change made room for a more positive and inclusive view of neurological differences. A movement for disability rights also started in the 1960s in the US. This movement said that people with disabilities have rights, and society should include them. The movement challenged old ideas that said having a disability is a problem. People with autism also spoke up for themselves. They said that autism is not just a problem but also a part of who they are. They wanted to show that they have strengths and unique ways of thinking. Judy Singer, a key figure in the development of the concept of neurodiversity, learned about the idea of autism as a spectrum from the Autism Association of Australia. This understanding, influenced by British psychologist Lorna Wing's work, recognized autism as a diverse condition that extends into the broader human experience. Singer's daughter's diagnosis with Asperger's syndrome led her to recognize similar traits in herself, such as difficulty making eye contact and being disorganized. Singer, who worked in the IT industry, later pursued studies in sociology and disability at the University of Technology in Sydney. With the advent of the internet, she engaged in online communities, including one called ILMV, where she collaborated with Harvey Blume. Through their discussions, Singer coined the term \"neurodiversity,\" in the mid 1990-s, emphasizing the value of diverse neurological conditions inspired by biodiversity in nature, which is about valuing different species. Singer undertook a thesis titled \"Odd People In,\" exploring the emergence of a new social movement based on neurological diversity. The thesis focused on online communities and the need for autistic people's voices to be heard and respected. Singer's work contributed to the growing neurodiversity movement, advocating for the rights and inclusion of neurodivergent individuals. Neurodiversity is the idea that we should value and include people with different ways of thinking, like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and more. It says that being different is not a bad thing; it adds to the richness of human experience. Neurodiversity has become an important idea. It changed how we talk about and see neurological differences. The neurodiversity movement works for the rights and inclusion of people with different ways of thinking in all parts of life.",

      "content": "In another twist, research notes from 1925, made by a Russian Jewish woman psychologist reveal a much more nuanced and modern understanding of autism. Irina Manouilenko, is psychiatrist based in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2013, Manouilenko translated Grunya Sukhareva's original descriptions of autism from Russian to English and compared them with the diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5. Upon examination, Manouilenko found significant similarities between Sukhareva's early observations and the contemporary criteria for autism in the DSM-5. This discovery highlighted the noteworthy alignment between Sukhareva's work in the early 20th century and the current understanding of autism. Grunya Sukhareva – overlooked pioneer – 1925 Sukhareva, a Soviet child psychiatrist, independently observed children displaying social withdrawal, language difficulties, and repetitive behaviors. Her detailed description of autistic features in the six boys she observed was published in 1925, nearly two decades before the more widely known work of Asperger and Kanner. Sukhareva recognized the unique cognitive profiles of the children she studied, emphasizing differences in information processing and engagement with the world. Her focus on early childhood and the importance of early identification and intervention aligns with later perspectives on autism. Sukhareva held a positive view regarding children's ability to adapt successfully under favorable conditions. She emphasized the significance of the social environment, proper upbringing, and education in stimulating compensatory opportunities for children. Sukhareva, as a child psychiatrist, observed and highlighted how crucial these factors were in aiding children's adaptation within their families and at school. This perspective aligned with her evolutionary-biological concept of mental illness. In her 1926 paper, Sukhareva balanced her descriptions by also noting unconventional behavior and challenges faced by the children she observed. Sukhareva also documented motor coordination issues in some children, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of autism that recognizes the diverse challenges individuals may face. Overall, Sukhareva's pioneering work laid a foundation for the evolving understanding of autism. Sula Wolff, a psychiatrist based in Edinburgh, praised Sukhareva's 1926 publication, stating that Sukhareva summarized the children's characteristics \"admirably\" and described her work as \"marvellous.\" According to Manouilenko and Bejerot, Sukhareva's descriptions were considered \"structured, elegant, detailed,\" and \"vivid.\" They also noted that Sukhareva's ideas on ways to help autistic children were remarkably \"modern.\" Manouilenko and Bejerot suggest that Sukhareva’s gender, her Jewish identity, Russian nationality, and her publications in Russian and German were not an effective combination for gaining worldwide attention in the 1920s. One can only bemoan the loss to the autism community, clearly due to the established discrimination.",

      "content": "Cures and Treatments - be cautious In this section we examine some of the alternative treatments to autism. ::: {.callout-caution} Please note that the alternative treatments for autism discussed here are considered ineffective and some can be outright dangerous. These are included to provide a cautionary note and are NOT recommended. ::: Why do people seek alternative treatments? There are many alternative treatments or protocols advised for conditions like diabetes, skin allergies or even cancer. Similarly, there have been many alternative treatments that have been and continue to be practiced for autism, despite no evidence of effectiveness. In some cases, people believe in and are willing to try alternative approaches, even when there is evidence of harm. What prompts people to try these approaches, against all reason? Newly discovered conditions When a condition is newly discovered or becomes widespread, and an effective treatment is yet to be determined, it is typical for people to explore a range of potential causes, treatments and “cures”. An approach that might have been effective for a different condition that appears to be related may be tried. For example, in the case of COVID, when the infection hit, there was no cure. Healthcare workers primarily focused on providing symptomatic treatment and tried approaches that worked for other infections and respiratory conditions like flu. A variety of treatments ranging from allopathy, ayurveda to homeopathy were tried before a vaccine was developed and a protocol that works was devised. Seeking better results with less effort Even when some understanding and evidence-based interventions are available, there might be a desire to seek alternative solutions in the hope of achieving better or anticipated results, and with lesser effort. For example, it is understood that diabetes cannot be cured but can be managed with lifestyle changes. Many people find these lifestyle changes difficult to make and maintain. They seek alternative approaches instead. Inability to critically evaluate It is also possible that people may not have the mental capacity to critically evaluate the feasibility of promised cures versus the potential harm as they deal with the stress placed by the condition they are dealing with. Sometimes they also believe that they have tried everything there is to try and there is no harm in trying one more thing. You see this approach in people dealing with cancer and such life threatening conditions. The case of autism Many of these factors seem to be working in the case of people who are willing to try alternative treatments for autism. Autism has been a poorly understood condition whose cause is not clearly known. It impacts children and it is no secret that many of us do not understand parenting, education and child development well enough. When a child is diagnosed with autism, parents do not immediately understand all the implications and its lifelong impact. Many see it as improper behavior on the child’s part or a set of symptoms that are preventing the child from going to school and seek to address them quickly, in time for the child to join a school. They also hear from healthcare professionals that there is no medical cure for autism. The evidence based interventions are behavioral, requiring significant time, energy and resource commitment from everyone involved. Most people are stressed out with the effort of bringing up the child and an autism diagnosis just makes things worse. It is in such an environment that alternative approaches, promising cures or at least significant improvements quickly, with little or no effort, become popular. Some of these are approaches that work for another condition, e.g. chelation, which is a treatment for heavy metal toxicity. Chelation was tried for autism initially because symptoms of autism resembled mercury poisoning and later because people believed autism was caused by mercury from vaccines. Similarly, hyperbaric oxygen therapy works for traumatic brain injury and was tried for autism because people believed increasing oxygen supply to the brain can help autism. There is homeopathy, which has been tried for everything that is not well understood in current medical science. In the Indian context, there is ayurveda, siddha and other alternative systems offering everything from remedies to cures for autism. Many others like restrictive diets are approaches that claim to cure a wide variety of conditions. Caution: Alternative approaches Currently, we understand Autism as a brain wired differently. Symptoms of autism may pose some social challenges for individuals in the spectrum, for which one can seek symptomatic treatment to enable a functional and meaningful life within the society. The cause of autism is unclear and so is the cure for autism. Scientifically, no evidence supports the existence of a \"cure\" for autism. Evidence-based interventions aim to manage specific symptoms, yet other interventions driven by speculative theories of \"curing\" autism not only lack efficacy but can also result in severe side effects. Consequently, interventions that demand careful attention and caution include: + Chelation + Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) + Stem cell therapy + Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) + Restrictive diets + Homeopathy + Ayurveda When to be critical Some treatments might appear appealing due to their success in addressing a different condition with similar symptoms, success stories from certain individuals, or alignment with personal beliefs or expectations of a cure. However, it is important to exercise serious caution when the intervention is promoted in the following ways: + The treatment lacks substantial scientific evidence or is based on unverified claims. + There is pressure or persuasion to adopt the intervention without clear and transparent information about its potential risks. + The treatment is presented as a \"miracle cure\" or a one-size-fits-all solution for a complex condition like autism. + Claims of success are primarily anecdotal and not supported by reliable research or clinical evidence. + The intervention involves risks or potentially harmful side effects that are not adequately addressed or disclosed. A guide to decision making Distinguishing between legitimate therapies and questionable ones can be challenging, particularly when conventional approaches seem ineffective for parents of autistic children. While alternative treatments may, in some cases, offer assistance, it's crucial to recognize that no single method is universally effective for treating autism. If you are contemplating a non-traditional option, the following questions can guide your decision-making process: + Who is recommending this option and what do they have to gain if you accept? + What do reliable sources such as the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) or NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) or The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) have to say about this particular method? + What do established organizations led by people living with autism, such as the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN), Action for Autism (AFA) and the Autistic Women and Nonbinary Network (AWN) have to say about this therapy? + Is this method aimed at \"curing\" autism? + What are the potential risks related to using this treatment? + What methods are in place to ensure the person's safety? + How will you measure changes or improvements?",

This restriction has been implemented due to misleading promotions and false claims. The only way to legally and ethically access stem cell therapy is to participate in an approved clinical trial. ::: What are stem cells? Stem cells are a group of cells that are present in our bodies through all stages of life. In fact, they are one of the first cells developed during the embryo stage. These cells, under the right environment, have the ability to generate new stem cells and also other cells with specialized functions (blood cells, brain cells, bone cells etc.) Because of this unique feature, stem cells play a key role in the development of newborn children and also in the restorative processes after a disease or an injury. Their ability to self-renew and multiply, ensures an ongoing source of new cells to replace old or injured ones. During the developmental years, this growth is vital for maturing into an adult. Once development is complete, this ongoing growth aids in healing and repairing damaged tissues or organs at a cellular level. These special characteristics make stem cells highly important in regenerative medicine, as they can create entire tissues and organs from just a small group of precursor cells.This characteristic of stem cells has kindled research interest in trying this as a treatment for various diseases. What is stem cell therapy? Stem cell therapy, also known as regenerative medicine, aids in fixing damaged, malfunctioning, or injured tissues using stem cells or their byproducts. It marks a new phase in organ transplantation, utilizing cells rather than donor organs that are limited. In laboratories, scientists cultivate stem cells under favorable conditions. These cells are modified to become specific cell types, like heart muscle, blood, or nerve cells. These specialized cells can be placed into a person's body. For instance, if someone has a heart condition, these cells might be inserted into the heart muscle. The transplanted healthy heart muscle cells may assist in repairing the damaged heart muscle. History of stem cell therapy Zoologists Theodor Heinrich Boveri and Valentin Häcker used the term stem cell to describe cells committed to give rise to the germline. + 1950s - scientists studied the potential of stem cells majorly through bone marrow and its role in generating various blood cells + 1956 - first successful bone marrow transplant was done. This procedure laid the foundation for using stem cells in medical treatments, especially in treating diseases like leukemia and other blood-related disorders. + 1981 - mouse embryonic stem cells was first cultured in the laboratory + 1988 - first umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant took place in a child with Fancoi’s anemia. + 1998 - scientists isolated and cultured human embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough enabled researchers to work with cells that had the potential to develop into almost any cell type in the human body. This discovery opened up new possibilities for regenerative medicine and treatment of a wide array of diseases and injuries. + 2006 - Discovered the technique of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), which involves transforming adult skin cells into cells that closely mimic human embryonic stem cells + Presently, stem cell therapy is applied in various areas of medicine. For example, bone marrow transplants are used in the treatment of leukemia and other blood disorders. Stem cells are being researched and utilized for regenerative medicine to potentially treat conditions such as heart disease, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and more. Clinical trials and research studies continue to explore the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for various health conditions. Why was it tried for autism? Stem cell therapy has been considered as a potential treatment for autism due to the belief that it might target certain biological mechanisms or symptoms (immune system regulation and inflammation, neural connectivity, etc.) associated with the condition. Reasons why stem cell therapy is being explored for autism include: + Regenerative Potential: Stem cells possess the capability to transform into various cell types. The idea is that they might aid in repairing or regenerating damaged or dysfunctional cells in the brain or nervous system, potentially impacting autism-related symptoms. + Inflammation and Immune Modulation: Studies suggest that immune system dysregulation or inflammation might contribute to certain cases of autism. Some types of stem cells, particularly mesenchymal stem cells, have shown potential in regulating immune responses and reducing inflammation. Researchers hope that this immune-modulating ability might alleviate certain autism-related symptoms. + Neuroprotective and Neurotrophic Effects: Stem cells produce substances that support the growth and survival of neurons. Researchers explore whether stem cells could protect existing neurons, encourage neuronal growth, and potentially enhance neural connections in individuals with autism. + Experimental Nature of Treatment: While conventional treatments for autism primarily focus on behavioral and therapeutic interventions, stem cell therapy is considered experimental. It aims to address potential underlying biological factors that traditional therapies might not directly target. However, it's essential to understand that while stem cell therapy has shown promise in various medical areas, its effectiveness and safety in treating autism are still being investigated. Clinical trials exploring the safety and potential efficacy of stem cell therapy for autism began in the early 2010s. These trials aimed to investigate the safety, feasibility, and any potential improvements in behavior, communication, and other symptoms associated with autism. It remains an experimental and unproven treatment for autism. The scientific and medical community stress the necessity for further comprehensive research, including well-designed clinical trials, to determine its safety, efficacy, and long-term impact on individuals with autism. Caution Stem cell therapy for Autism is still under investigation and there is no established finding of cure in using the treatment for autism. There are limited studies and no definitive results yet. Among the limited studies, the results cannot be generalized as all of the studies have a small sample size. Like any medical intervention, stem cell therapy also carries potential risks. + Unintended side effects or complications could arise from the procedure, such as infection, immune rejection, or the formation of tumors. + The outcomes of stem cell therapy for autism can vary widely from person to person. It's difficult to predict how an individual will respond to the treatment or if it will have any positive effects on their symptoms. + It involves invasive medical procedures and requires the individual to be admitted for at least 5 days. Furthermore, the treatment is hard on the pocket when done commercially. + Some facilities offering stem cell treatments might not adhere to strict regulatory standards or might lack sufficient scientific evidence supporting their procedures. If any medical center is experimenting and an individual is part of a clinical trial, they should be treated free of cost. + There have been reports of adverse short-term effects associated with stem cell therapy, including aggressive behavior, nausea, vomiting, and seizures. Research on the long-term effects of stem cell therapy is still in its early stages, and a comprehensive understanding of its lasting impact is yet to be established. Current status in India Starting around 2010, stem cell therapy has been advertised as a potential cure for autism by many practitioners in India, despite no evidence for the same. Many parents have fallen victim to the unethical medical and business practice associated with stem cell treatment. As of 2022, the use of stem cell therapy as a treatment or cure for autism is prohibited in India. This restriction has been implemented due to misleading promotions and false claims. Currently, stem cell therapy for conditions outlined in the National Guideline for Stem Cell Research (NGSCR) 2017, excluding Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)/ hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), is neither accessible nor permitted. Individuals can only participate in stem cell treatment through a clinical trial if they meet the specified criteria for the trial. In this context, it's important to highlight that there is currently no clinical evidence validating the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treating autism. Therefore, any facility claiming otherwise should be approached with caution and careful consideration. The National Medical Council (NMC) calls it professional misconduct when anybody practices, advertises, or promotes stem cell therapy as a treatment or cure for autism. Given these factors, families considering stem cell therapy believing it will lead to significant improvements or a cure for autism need to seriously reconsider and make an informed decision. The only ethical and scientific way to get stem cell therapy is to participate in a well designed clinical trial or study. The path ahead demands a cautious approach to verify the safety, efficacy and long term impacts of the therapy. Here is a video created in 2023 by Yash Charitable Trust (YCT), and Forum for Autism, against the use of stem cell therapy as a treatment. {{}}",

      "content": "A diet is the combination and quantity of foods that an individual consumes. A healthy diet is one that provides all the necessary nutrients required for optimal well-being. Nutritional needs can vary based on factors such as geography, lifestyle, and health conditions. Therefore, individuals may benefit from diverse diets tailored to their specific requirements. One common symptom of autism is restricted eating patterns, making individuals with autism more susceptible to certain dietary challenges. Some individuals with autism may experience heightened sensitivity to taste and food textures, similar to their sensitivity to light and touch. This sensitivity can influence the types and quantities of food they consume. However, it's essential to note that the nutritional needs of individuals with autism are generally not significantly different from those of others in their age group. Therefore, exposing them to a healthy and varied diet is crucial for their overall development, unless there are specific allergies or intolerances to certain foods as some autistic individuals suffer from Gastrointestinal disturbances. Diet - Autism Connection The concept of diets impacting various autistic symptoms is rooted in the understanding of the gut-brain connection. The physical and biochemical connection between these two organs involves several mechanisms: + Vagus Nerve: The vagus nerve, one of the largest nerves in the body, establishes a strong connection between the gut and the brain. It facilitates the bidirectional transmission of signals. + Neurotransmitters: Chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters play a crucial role in connecting the gut and the brain. These neurotransmitters, which regulate emotions and feelings, are produced in the brain. For instance, serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with happiness and circadian rhythm control, is produced in both the brain and the gut. Additionally, gut microbes contribute to the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that helps manage feelings of fear and anxiety. + Gut Microbes: The trillions of microbes residing in the gut are integral to this connection. They produce various chemicals, including short-chain fatty acids that can reduce appetite and contribute to the formation of the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, these microbes play a role in immune system functioning, impacting inflammation. An overactive immune system can lead to inflammation, which, in turn, affects brain health. In summary, the physical and biochemical interactions between the gut and brain involve the vagus nerve, neurotransmitters, and the activities of gut microbes. These connections influence emotional well-being, immune responses, and inflammation, contributing to the overall health of both the gut and the brain. History of diet as therapy The use of diets as a treatment for various medical conditions has a long and diverse history, and different diets have been proposed and implemented for therapeutic purposes. + Ancient Civilizations: Ancient cultures recognized the influence of diet on health. Hippocrates, often referred to as the \"Father of Medicine\" in ancient Greece, emphasized the significance of diet in maintaining health and preventing disease. + Fasting in Ancient Religions: Fasting has been a practice in many ancient religions for spiritual and health-related reasons. It is believed to purify the body and mind. + Diet in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda: Traditional Chinese Medicine and the traditional system of medicine in India, Ayurveda, incorporate dietary principles as essential components of holistic healthcare. These systems emphasize balancing energies within the body through proper nutrition. + Diet in the Middle Ages: In medieval Europe, dietary practices were often influenced by religious beliefs. Fasting and abstaining from certain foods were common practices in the belief of purifying the body from toxins. + Vitamin Deficiency Diseases: In the 18th and 19th centuries, the recognition of deficiency diseases, such as scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) and rickets (vitamin D deficiency), led to the understanding of the role of specific nutrients in preventing and treating illnesses. + Diets for Epilepsy: The ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, was introduced in the 1920s as a treatment for epilepsy. It fell out of favor with the advent of antiepileptic drugs but experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century. + Dietary Approaches for Specific Conditions: Over the years, various diets have been proposed and explored for specific health conditions. For example, the low-sodium DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet for managing hypertension and the Mediterranean diet for heart health gained recognition. + Development of Therapeutic Diets: Therapeutic diets, designed to manage specific health conditions, have been developed. These include the gluten-free diet for celiac disease, the low-FODMAP diet for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the low-phenylalanine diet for phenylketonuria (PKU). + Emergence of Dietary Therapies for Neurodevelopmental Disorders: In recent years, specific dietary interventions, like the gluten-free, casein-free (GFCF) diet, have been investigated for conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dr. Karl Reichelt proposed a hypothesis in 1991, suggesting that the consumption of gluten and casein by individuals with celiac disease might contribute to autism, particularly in those predisposed to the condition. According to this theory, these proteins, in the presence of a \"leaky gut,\" could be absorbed, leading to the creation of peptides with opioid-like effects. These peptides, in turn, were theorized to mimic or induce autism. This hypothesis led to the development of the Gluten-Free and Casein-Free diet (GFCF), sparking considerable controversy. + Current Trends: Today, there is growing interest in the role of diet in overall health and disease prevention. Diets like the ketogenic diet, paleolithic diet, and plant-based diets are popular, and research continues to explore their potential benefits. It's important to note that while dietary interventions can play a role in managing certain health conditions, the effectiveness of specific diets varies, and not all dietary approaches have robust scientific support. Individuals considering dietary changes for therapeutic purposes should consult with respective healthcare professionals to ensure that nutritional needs are met and that the chosen diet is appropriate for their specific health condition. It also helps to do some self-study from reliable resources to see if a specific dietary approach will be feasible for the autistic individual and the family. Types of diets for autism In the light of gut brain connection, many diets have been suggested and tried as a treatment for various disorders including autistic symptoms. Diverse dietary interventions have been proposed for individuals with autism, yet it's crucial to note that the scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of these diets is often limited and varied. Here are some diet types suggested for autism: + Gluten-Free, Casein-Free (GFCF) Diet: This involves removing gluten (found in wheat, barley, and rye) and casein (found in dairy) from the individual's diet. Advocates claim potential improvements in behavior and social interactions. This is the most researched and commonly suggested intervention. + Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD): A restrictive diet eliminating complex carbohydrates, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. It permits specific easily digestible carbohydrates, aiming to positively impact gut health and alleviate autism-related symptoms. + Ketogenic Diet: A high-fat, low-carb diet used for epilepsy. Some reports suggest potential positive effects on behavior and cognitive function in individuals with autism. It has been suggested that epilepsy drives the development for ASD. + Low-Oxalate Diet: Restricts foods high in oxalates, compounds found in some fruits, veggies, and nuts. Advocates claim it may alleviate sensory processing and gut-related symptoms in autism. + Low-FODMAP Diet: Designed to reduce fermentable carbohydrates, potentially beneficial for individuals with autism and gastrointestinal issues, though more research is needed. + Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation: While not a specific diet, some individuals with autism are recommended omega-3 supplements for potential benefits in cognitive function and behavior. Approaching these dietary interventions cautiously is crucial, given the often inconclusive evidence regarding their effectiveness for autism. Individual responses can vary, and restrictive diets may pose challenges in meeting nutritional needs. Caution It's essential to clearly understand why a dietary approach is chosen to manage autism symptoms and carefully assess associated costs. The relationship between autism and diet is an ongoing area of study, with existing research often lacking robust methodology, relying on anecdotal reports or personal experiences. The mechanism underlying the effectiveness of a diet for autism remains an unresolved research question, primarily based on the assumption that individuals with autism having an imbalanced gut microbiota contribute to their autism symptoms. Considering autism's multifactorial nature, there is no evidence that only an imbalanced gut causes autism. Accepting an intervention solely based on authority or convenience should be avoided, especially if it compromises the health of the individual with autism. Each diet comes with its own benefits and costs. The side effects or consequences of following these diets can vary, and individual responses may differ. Here are some considerations: + Nutritional Deficiencies: Restrictive diets, especially those that eliminate entire food groups, may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies. For example, the GFCF diet excludes wheat and dairy, which are sources of essential nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and fiber. Studies have reported low bone mineral densities among individuals with autism who have excluded dairy from their diets. It's important to ensure that nutritional needs are met through alternative food sources or supplements. + Further Gastrointestinal Distress: Dietary changes, particularly those involving the removal of certain foods, can sometimes lead to gastrointestinal distress. This may include changes in bowel habits, constipation, or diarrhea. It's crucial to monitor and address any digestive issues that may arise. + Social and Practical Challenges: Following a specialized diet can present social and practical challenges. Individuals with autism may already have preferences or sensitivities to certain textures or flavors, and imposing further dietary restrictions may affect their willingness to eat or participate in social activities. + Emotional Impact: Dietary interventions can have emotional implications, particularly for children or individuals who may find it challenging to adapt to changes in their eating habits. It's important to consider the emotional well-being of individuals with autism when implementing dietary changes. + Financial Costs: Some specialized diets may involve increased costs due to the need for specific ingredients, supplements, or alternative food products. Studies suggest that gluten free products are a certain percentage more expensive than products with gluten and casein. Considering the longeveity of intervention, it would be a sustained expense. Families should be aware of the financial implications and plan accordingly. + Unsubstantiated Claims and Lack of Evidence: Many of the suggested diets for autism are based on anecdotal evidence rather than robust scientific research. Following a diet without sufficient evidence of its effectiveness may lead to disappointment and frustration if the expected benefits are not realized. + Potential for Nutritional Excess: In some cases, the emphasis on certain food groups or supplements in an attempt to address specific symptoms may lead to an imbalance and excess intake of certain nutrients. This can have its own set of health implications. Consulting healthcare professionals, including accredited dietitians and specialists in autism, and thoroughly assessing the feasibility of the chosen approach in the context of the child's health and family circumstances is essential to ensure that the selected diet is safe and suitable for overall well-being. It is reiterated that there is no definitive evidence supporting the sole effectiveness of a diet for managing autism. In most studies, the change in behaviors post diet are reports from parents and there has been no objective measurement of the same.",

      "content": "Homeopathy is a system of alternative medicine that was developed in the late 18th century by Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician. The central principle of homeopathy is the \"law of similars,\" which states that a substance that can cause symptoms in a healthy person can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person. This concept is often expressed by the Latin phrase \"similia similibus curentur,\" meaning \"like cures like.\" Homeopathic remedies are prepared through a process called potentization, which involves a series of dilutions and succussions (vigorous shaking). The idea is that this process enhances the therapeutic properties of the substance while minimizing its toxic effects. The remedies are crafted for individuals based on the information shared about lifestyle, medical history, and current symptoms. It is thus believed to have a personalized and holistic approach to treatment. Homeopathy relies on the principle of individualization, suggesting that treatments should be tailored to each person's unique symptoms and constitution. However, this variability makes it challenging to conduct large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that meet rigorous scientific standards. Consequently, the lack of standardized protocols and the individualized nature of homeopathy make it difficult to establish its effectiveness across diverse populations. While homeopathy has its proponents, it's essential to acknowledge that its efficacy is a subject of significant debate within the scientific and medical communities. History of homeopathy Homeopathy was founded by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), who obtained his medical degree in Erlangen in 1779. Despite struggling financially during his initial years as a physician, Hahnemann made a significant discovery that would shape his future. In an experiment, he began taking regular doses of cinchona, also known as 'the bark' or quinine. Remarkably, he experienced symptoms similar to those of intermittent fever (malaria) but in a milder form and without the characteristic rigors of the disease. This observation sparked a groundbreaking idea. In 1796, Hahnemann published his findings in \"Essay on a New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Drugs.\" This was followed by his influential work, \"The Organon of the Healing Art,\" in 1810. These works laid out the fundamental principles of homeopathy, including the \"law of similars\" and the process of potentization, shaping the foundation of this alternative medical system. Despite initial financial struggles, Hahnemann's contributions to homeopathy gained recognition and had a lasting impact on the field of alternative medicine. Here is a timeline of how homeopathy progressed: + 1796: Dissatisfied with the medical practices of his time, Samuel Hahnemann began experimenting with the use of substances to treat various illnesses. He first describes the Law of Similars (“Like cures like”). This principle suggests that a substance that can cause symptoms in a healthy person can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person. + Late 18th Century: Hahnemann conducted a series of experiments on himself and others, ingesting small doses of substances to observe their effects. He systematically recorded the symptoms produced and proposed the use of highly diluted doses of substances to treat similar symptoms in patients. + 1810: Hahnemann published his foundational work, \"Organon of the Healing Art,\" outlining the principles and practices of homeopathy. The text underwent several editions, with the final edition, the sixth, published posthumously in 1921. + 1830s: Homeopathic schools and hospitals begin to open in the United States and Europe. + 1838: Repertory to the More Characteristic Symptoms of Materia Medica, a homeopathic reference, first appears in English. + 1842: Oliver Wendel Holmes Sr.—physician, critic of homeopathy and father of a Supreme Court justice—publishes the scathing “Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions.” + 1847: The American Medical Association is founded, offering a decidedly unfavorable view of homeopathy. Homeopathy faced criticism and challenges, particularly from proponents of conventional medicine. + 1885: Hahnemann Hospital opens as a homeopathic facility in Philadelphia. + Mid-1900s: Homeopathic schools dwindle and disappear. Hahnemann Hospital is sold to new owners, who switch to allopathic medicine but retain a homeopathic library and some elective courses. The Flexner Report in the early 20th century, which led to the reform of medical education in the United States, marginalized homeopathy in favor of allopathic medicine. + 1972: The Center for Education and Development of Clinical Homeopathy was founded with the goal of teaching practical, pragmatic homeopathy at campuses across the country, including one in Philadelphia. In the latter half of the 20th century, there was a resurgence of interest in alternative and complementary medicine, including homeopathy. Some individuals sought out homeopathic treatments as an alternative or complementary approach to conventional medicine. + Current Status: Homeopathy is practiced in various parts of the world, and homeopathic remedies are available over the counter in many countries. However, its acceptance within the mainstream medical community varies, with skepticism regarding its scientific basis and efficacy. Homeopathy continues to be a subject of debate and controversy within the scientific and medical communities. Research on the efficacy of homeopathic treatments has yielded mixed results, and debates persist on issues such as the mechanisms of action and the significance of highly diluted substances. Why homeopathy for autism? The multifaceted nature of autism has led to the exploration of various \"cures\" for the condition. The application of homeopathy to autism lacks a clear rationale. Considering homeopathy is often considered an alternative medicine, it is applied broadly across different conditions. The decision to try homeopathy for autism might stem from a dissatisfaction with the gradual outcomes of evidence-based management and a natural inclination to explore every possible way for improvement. Advocates assert that homeopathy enhances behavioral symptoms associated with autism, including aggressiveness, sensory processing issues, language, speech, and communication. However, these claims rely solely on anecdotal evidence. There is a notable absence of valid scientific evidence explaining the mechanisms by which homeopathy works for some individuals and not for others. The lack of a robust scientific foundation raises questions about the reliability and generalizability of reported improvements associated with homeopathic treatments for autism. Certain homeopathic practitioners argue against the use of randomized controlled trials, stating that patient satisfaction should be the sole criterion for judging the effectiveness of homeopathy. However, when clinical trials and systematic reviews have been conducted, the outcomes remain uncertain. While a few studies suggested slight effectiveness, a majority indicated that homeopathy had no therapeutic effect. It's important to note that many trials included in systematic reviews were deemed imperfect in terms of design, application, or sample size. This highlights the challenges in establishing conclusive evidence regarding the efficacy of homeopathy through rigorous scientific methods. The Process of homeopathy for autism Homeopathic treatment for autism follows a personalized approach rooted in the principles of homeopathy. The process involves the following steps: + Initial consultation: A comprehensive discussion with the individual with autism or their caregivers to collect information on medical history, behavioral symptoms, sensory sensitivities, and emotional well-being. + Individualized assessment: A focus on understanding the unique expression of symptoms in each person, including their overall constitution, temperament, and responses to various stimuli. + Choosing the homeopathic remedy: Choosing a homeopathic remedy that aligns with the individual's symptoms and constitutional characteristics. These remedies are often highly diluted substances derived from plants, minerals, or animals. + Potentization: Subjecting the chosen remedy to potentization, involving dilution and succussion (vigorous shaking) to enhance therapeutic properties while minimizing potential toxic effects. Administration of the remedy: Providing the homeopathic remedy in a highly diluted form, typically as small sugar pellets or liquid drops. The dosage and frequency are determined by the homeopath's recommendations. + Follow-Up consultations: Regular follow-up sessions to evaluate the individual's response to the remedy and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. These consultations help monitor changes in symptoms and emotional well-being. + Monitoring progress: Continuously assessing the person's progress, considering changes in behavioral symptoms, sensory sensitivities, and communication skills relevant to autism. Adjustments to the homeopathic remedy may be made based on the individual's response. Caution Caution should be exercised when contemplating homeopathy as a treatment for autism, given several compelling reasons, despite its popularity in certain alternative medicine circles. Here are key factors contributing to the need for caution: + Lack of Scientific Evidence: The foundational principles of homeopathy, such as the law of similars and the use of highly diluted substances, lack robust scientific backing. Studies on homeopathic treatments for autism are often limited, with small-scale research producing mixed and inconclusive results. + Placebo Effect: Perceived benefits from homeopathic treatments may be influenced by the placebo effect, where improvements result from the belief in treatment efficacy rather than the treatment itself. This can lead to subjective reports of improvement that may not be objectively measurable. + Individual Variability in Responses: Responses to homeopathic treatments vary widely among individuals, making it challenging to predict outcomes. This variability is compounded by the diverse nature of autism symptoms, complicating the assessment of treatment efficacy. + Risk of Delaying or Avoiding Evidence-Based Interventions: Relying solely on homeopathy may lead to delays in accessing evidence-based interventions with demonstrated efficacy. Established components of effective autism management, such as early and intensive behavioral interventions, may be postponed. + Financial Costs: Homeopathic treatments, like other alternative therapies, may incur financial costs. Families should consider the potential financial burden, especially when these treatments lack robust scientific support. + Potential for Harm: While homeopathic remedies are generally considered safe due to their highly diluted nature, harm may occur if individuals forego proven medical treatments in favor of homeopathy. Prioritizing interventions with a solid scientific basis is crucial. + Unregulated Nature of Homeopathic Products: Homeopathic products may not undergo the same regulatory scrutiny as conventional medications. Variability in quality control and manufacturing consistency raises concerns about the reliability and safety of these products. + Ethical Considerations: The use of homeopathy for autism raises ethical considerations, especially when individuals or families are led to believe in the efficacy of a treatment lacking strong scientific support. Providing accurate and transparent information about the evidence base for any therapeutic approach is essential. In summary, exercising caution is important when considering homeopathy for autism, considering the lack of scientific validation, the potential for the placebo effect, individual variability, the risk of delaying evidence-based interventions, financial costs, the potential for harm, and the unregulated nature of homeopathic products. Prioritizing evidence-based interventions and consulting with healthcare professionals ensures informed decisions regarding the management of autism spectrum disorder.",

      "content": "Ayurveda, an ancient natural system of medicine said to have originated in India over 3,000 years ago, derives its name from the Sanskrit words \"ayur\" (life) and \"veda\" (science or knowledge), translating to “knowledge of life”. Advocates of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), such as Ayurveda, subscribe to the belief that the world operates in a state of balance. According to this perspective, optimal health is achieved when living creatures are in harmony with the universe. Conversely, disruptions in this balance are thought to lead to illnesses. Ayurveda treatment approaches health by focusing on restoring this balance as a means of addressing and treating various health conditions. It advocates for specific lifestyle interventions and natural therapies to restore balance among the body, mind, spirit, and the environment. According to Ayurveda, every person is made of the five basic elements found in the universe: Air, water, fire, space and earth. Central to Ayurvedic medicine are concepts such as universal interconnectedness, the body's constitution (prakriti), and life forces (doshas). Treatment goals aim to eliminate impurities, alleviate symptoms, enhance disease resistance, reduce stress, and promote harmony in life. Treatment in Ayurveda commences with an internal purification process, followed by a tailored diet, herbal remedies, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation. Ayurvedic practitioners extensively use herbs, plants, oils, and common spices in their treatments. In India, Ayurveda holds the status of a recognized form of medical care, alongside conventional Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathic medicine, and homeopathic medicine. When utilized as a complementary therapy alongside standard conventional medical care, Ayurveda has demonstrated some positive effects. However, it's crucial to note that many Ayurvedic materials have not undergone extensive research in both Western and Indian contexts. Some products used in Ayurvedic medicine may include herbs, metals, minerals, or other substances that could pose harm if used improperly or without the guidance of a trained practitioner. Therefore, caution and expert guidance are advised when considering Ayurvedic treatments. Ayurveda and Autism The idea of using Ayurveda for autism is a relatively recent development and is part of the broader interest in alternative and complementary therapies for managing various health conditions. Ayurveda, as an ancient system of medicine, has a long history, but its application to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) gained attention in the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st century. There is limited scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of Ayurveda in improving autism symptoms. Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine, encompasses a holistic approach to health and well-being. While some proponents suggest that Ayurvedic practices may offer benefits for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it's crucial to note that research in this area is limited. The scientific community remains cautious about making definitive claims regarding the effectiveness of Ayurveda for autism. Some individuals and families may explore Ayurveda as a complementary or alternative therapy for autism based on the following principles: + Holistic Approach: Ayurveda takes a holistic approach, considering the interconnectedness of the mind, body, and spirit. The belief is that balancing these aspects can contribute to overall health and well-being. + Individualized Treatment: Ayurvedic treatments are often individualized based on a person's unique constitution or dosha. The idea is that addressing specific imbalances in an individual's constitution may promote health and alleviate symptoms. + Dietary and Lifestyle Recommendations: Ayurveda places significant emphasis on dietary and lifestyle practices. Recommendations may include specific dietary modifications, the use of herbal remedies, and the incorporation of practices such as meditation, yoga, and breathing exercises. + Stress Reduction: Stress reduction is considered essential in Ayurveda for maintaining balance and preventing disease. Practices that promote relaxation and reduce stress, such as meditation and yoga, may be recommended. + Herbal Remedies: Ayurveda incorporates the use of herbal remedies, derived from plants and natural substances. Some herbal formulations in Ayurveda are believed to have properties that may support cognitive function and address symptoms associated with neurological conditions. It's crucial to highlight the need for rigorous scientific research to establish the safety and effectiveness of Ayurveda in the context of autism. While anecdotal reports and individual testimonials may suggest positive outcomes, these do not substitute for well-designed clinical trials with large sample sizes and rigorous methodologies. If individuals or families are considering Ayurveda for autism, it is strongly advised to consult with healthcare professionals, particularly those with expertise in autism. Integrating Ayurveda into an overall care plan in collaboration with conventional evidence-based interventions is essential. Open communication with healthcare providers ensures that any therapeutic approach aligns with the best interests and well-being of individuals with autism. History of Ayurveda The history of Ayurveda is deeply rooted in ancient Indian civilization, and its principles have been passed down through oral traditions and written texts. Its foundations are deeply rooted in the ancient schools of Hindu Philosophical teachings, specifically the Vaisheshika school and the school of logic known as Nyaya. Additionally, Ayurveda is closely connected to the manifestation framework, commonly recognized as Samkhya. It emerged during the same period when the schools of Nyaya and Vaisheshika were flourishing. Ayurveda is also said to have a divine origin, believed to come from the Hindu God Brahma, who is considered the creator of the universe. Before the establishment of philosophical schools, this holistic knowledge of healing was passed from Brahma to sages, who then shared it with their disciples and the general population through writings and spoken stories. They described the healing properties of herbs in poetic verses called \"Shlokas.\" Ayurveda's foundation lies in four important collections of knowledge called Vedas. The Rig Veda, the most famous among them, talks about 67 plants and 1028 Shlokas. The Atharva Veda and Yajur Veda mention 293 and 81 plants with medicinal uses, respectively. Ayurveda's practice is deeply rooted in the insights gained from these ancient Vedas. Following is an overview of the history of Ayurveda: + Vedic Period (1500 BCE - 600 BCE): The earliest roots of Ayurveda can be traced back to the Vedic period in ancient India. The knowledge of Ayurveda is believed to be part of the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. The Rigveda, one of the Vedic texts, contains hymns related to healing and the use of medicinal plants. + Compilation of Ayurvedic Texts (600 BCE - 200 CE): The foundational texts of Ayurveda, known as the \"Samhitas,\" were compiled during this period. The most significant among them are the Charaka Samhita, attributed to the sage Charaka (physician), and the Sushruta Samhita, attributed to the sage Sushruta (surgeon). These texts cover various aspects of health, disease, diagnosis, treatment, and surgical procedures. + Golden Age of Ayurveda (200 CE - 1200 CE): During this period, Ayurveda flourished and became more organized. The works of influential scholars such as Vagbhata contributed to the development and systematization of Ayurvedic knowledge. The Ashtanga Hridaya, written by Vagbhata, is an important compendium that synthesized earlier Ayurvedic teachings. + Islamic Influence (1200 CE - 1800 CE): With the advent of Islamic rule in India, Ayurveda faced challenges but continued to evolve. Some Ayurvedic texts were translated into Arabic, and Unani medicine, influenced by Ayurveda, emerged as a distinct medical tradition. + Colonial Period (17th Century Onward): The colonial period saw the arrival of European powers in India. The British East India Company established control, and Ayurveda faced challenges during this period. The British colonial authorities initially viewed Ayurveda with skepticism. + Revival Efforts (Late 19th Century - 20th Century): The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed efforts to revive and institutionalize Ayurveda. Key figures such as Swami Dayananda Saraswati and Mahatma Gandhi emphasized the importance of traditional Indian systems of medicine, including Ayurveda. + Post-Independence Era (1947 Onward): After India gained independence in 1947, there were renewed efforts to promote and modernize Ayurveda. The establishment of institutions, research centers, and government initiatives aimed at preserving and promoting Ayurvedic knowledge. + Global Recognition and Integration (Late 20th Century Onward): In recent decades, there has been a growing global interest in Ayurveda. It has gained recognition as an alternative and complementary system of medicine worldwide. Ayurvedic practices, including herbal remedies, dietary recommendations, and lifestyle interventions, have found a place in integrative medicine approaches. Today, Ayurveda continues to be practiced in India and other parts of the world. It has influenced various alternative and complementary medicine practices and is recognized for its holistic approach to health and well-being. Despite its rich history, it's important to note that scientific validation and standardization of Ayurvedic practices remain ongoing challenges. Caution While some individuals and families may consider exploring Ayurveda as a complementary or alternative therapy for autism, it's important to approach it with caution and consider several factors. Here are some key points to keep in mind when seeking Ayurveda for autism: + Limited Scientific Evidence: There is limited scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of Ayurveda specifically for autism. Rigorous research, including well-designed clinical trials, is needed to establish its safety and effectiveness. + Individual Variability in Responses: Responses to Ayurvedic treatments can vary among individuals. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex and heterogeneous condition, and what works for one person may not work for another. Factors such as the severity of symptoms and overall health can influence individual responses. + Integration with Conventional Care: Ayurvedic approaches should be viewed as complementary rather than a substitute for evidence-based interventions recommended by healthcare providers. It's important to communicate openly with healthcare professionals, including those with expertise in autism, to ensure that Ayurveda is integrated into an overall care plan. + Safety Considerations: While Ayurveda is generally considered safe when practiced by trained practitioners, it's crucial to ensure that any herbal remedies or dietary recommendations align with the individual's overall health. Consult with healthcare professionals, especially if the individual is on any medications or has pre-existing health conditions. + Consultation with Qualified Practitioners: Seek Ayurvedic treatments from qualified practitioners who have training and experience in Ayurveda. Professional Ayurvedic practitioners may have certifications or qualifications from recognized institutions. Verify their credentials before starting any treatment. + Transparency and Informed Consent: Practitioners should be transparent about the nature of Ayurvedic treatments, potential benefits, and possible risks. Informed consent is essential, and individuals or caregivers should be fully informed about what to expect from Ayurvedic interventions. + Monitoring Progress: Regularly monitor the individual's progress and communicate with healthcare providers. If any concerns or unexpected changes arise, it's important to discuss them with both Ayurvedic practitioners and conventional healthcare professionals. + Financial Considerations: Consider the financial implications of Ayurvedic treatments, as some interventions may involve costs. Be aware of any potential financial burden and ensure that the chosen approach aligns with the overall budget for healthcare. + Cultural Sensitivity: Ayurveda is deeply rooted in Indian culture, and cultural sensitivity is important. Ensure that practitioners understand and respect the cultural context and preferences of the individuals and families seeking Ayurvedic care. + Ongoing Communication: Establish open and ongoing communication between Ayurvedic practitioners and other healthcare providers involved in the individual's care. Collaboration can contribute to a more comprehensive and integrated approach. It's important to recognize that individual experiences with Ayurveda may vary, and what works for one person may not work for another. For individuals or families considering Ayurveda for autism, consulting healthcare professionals, especially those knowledgeable about autism, is strongly advised. Integrating Ayurveda into an overall care plan should be a collaborative effort with healthcare providers familiar with both Ayurvedic principles and conventional evidence-based approaches to autism. Open communication ensures that any therapeutic approach aligns with the best interests and well-being of individuals with autism.",

      "content": "In hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), the individual enters a pressurized chamber where they inhale pure oxygen. Inside this chamber, the air pressure is double compared to the normal air we breathe outside. This treatment increases the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood, allowing it to reach the brain and other parts of the body. HBOT is based on the principle of delivering increased levels of oxygen to the body's tissues by exposing individuals to pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber. The primary components are increased atmospheric pressure and elevated oxygen concentration. It enables increased oxygen supply to organs that lack sufficient oxygen. The oxygen is dissolved in the blood, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluids.The increased oxygen levels stimulate and accelerate bodily functions that rely on oxygen, from essential processes like heartbeats to cognitive functions and movements. Due to this, HBOT has shown promising potential in addressing or lessening symptoms related to cognitive and mobility decline. Studies have indicated that the combination of high oxygen levels (hyperoxia) and pressure in a hyperbaric environment can boost tissue oxygenation. It is believed that this manipulation affects oxygen and pressure-sensitive genes, ultimately leading to improved tissue metabolism. History of HBOT The use of oxygen therapy goes back to 1662 when British physician Nathaniel Henshaw built the first pressurized room to treat pulmonary and digestive conditions. The basic principle behind Henshaw's work was the notion that breathing in a pressurized environment could have positive effects on health. However, the understanding of the physiological effects of increased pressure and the therapeutic applications of hyperbaric environments was in its infancy then. + 1662: The concept of increased atmospheric pressure influencing the human body was first proposed by British clergyman and scientist Henshaw. He built a \"Domicilium,\" a sealed chamber, and suggested that it could be used to treat various medical conditions. + 1834: French surgeon Junod constructed a portable hyperbaric chamber and reported beneficial effects on patients with various conditions. The Bulletin of the Academy of Medicine reported Dr. Junod’s success with a complete recovery from a variety of medical conditions. + 1861: Paul Bert, a French physiologist, conducted comprehensive studies on the effects of increased atmospheric pressure and discovered the toxic effects of high-pressure oxygen that were manifested as seizures. He is known as the “father of hyperbaric physiology” + 1900s- Interest in oxygen therapy resurged when French doctors observed that patients undergoing hyperbaric-assisted surgery experienced fewer complications. Dr. John S. Haldane played an important role in advancing this field by studying the effects of compressed oxygen and subsequently developing dive tables for the Royal Navy. He came to be known as \"Father of Oxygen Therapy.\" + 1928- Dr.Cunningham discovered that there is a difference in mortality rate between flu patients living in higher elevations compared to patients living at lower elevations. In higher elevations, one breathes in less oxygen. He built a 5 storey chamber that offered more than 60 rooms designed to treat flu patients. In addition, Harvard Medical School built its first hyperbaric chamber, + 1937-1942: The U.S. military used hyperbaric oxygen to treat deep-sea divers with decompression sickness, also known as the bends. + 1955- Churchill-Davidson applied HBO to potentiate the effects of radiation therapy in cancer patients, while at the same time Boerema developed HBO as an adjunct to cardiac surgery, thus prolonging the time for circulatory arrest + 1956: The U.S. Navy established the first hyperbaric research program to explore various therapeutic applications. + 1960s: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy gained recognition for treating conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning, crush injuries, and non-healing wounds. + 1970s: Hyperbaric chambers became more widely available, and research expanded to explore the therapy's potential in treating other conditions, including chronic non-healing wounds and certain infections. + 1980s: The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) was founded to promote research, education, and standards of practice in the field of hyperbaric medicine. + 1990s: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy gained popularity in treating chronic wounds, radiation injuries, and other conditions. However, there was controversy and debate about its efficacy in some applications. + 2000s: Research continued to explore the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for various neurological conditions, including traumatic brain injuries and certain neurodevelopmental disorders. + Present: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used as a standard treatment for conditions such as decompression sickness, chronic non-healing wounds, and certain infections. Ongoing research is exploring its potential applications in areas such as neurology, sports medicine, and chronic diseases. Why was HBOT used for autism? HBOT, given its principles, was believed to address the biological symptoms of autism such as immune system dysregulation and inflammation. It is still experimental and no regulatory body approves using HBOT as a treatment for autism. It was seen a as a potential treatment for autism due to: + Anti-Inflammatory Effects: Some studies have proposed that inflammation might play a role in the development of certain cases of autism causing communication issues and behaviors. HBOT, having its anti-inflammatory properties, is believed by some to potentially reduce inflammation in the brain, contributing to improvements in symptoms. + Oxygenation and Neural Function: The therapy involves exposing individuals to increased levels of oxygen, which may enhance oxygenation of tissues, including the brain. This increased oxygen availability is thought to support neural function and promote overall brain health. + Neuroprotection and Tissue Repair: HBOT is known for its role in promoting tissue repair and regeneration. Proponents of HBOT for autism suggest that the therapy might have neuroprotective effects and contribute to the repair of neural circuits, potentially improving certain aspects of neurological function in individuals with autism. + Blood Flow and Oxygen Delivery: The increased atmospheric pressure in the hyperbaric chamber enhances the solubility of oxygen in the blood, leading to higher oxygen concentrations in tissues. This is believed to improve blood flow and oxygen delivery to areas of the brain that may be affected in individuals with autism. + Mitigation of Oxidative Stress: Oxidative stress, resulting from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants, has been implicated in some cases of autism. HBOT proponents believe that HBOT may have antioxidant effects, potentially mitigating oxidative stress and its impact on the brain. Similar to other alternative treatments, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is categorized as an alternative treatment due to insufficient data, lack of conclusive evidence regarding its efficacy and impact. Comprehensive and definitive research is required before considering HBOT as a treatment for autism. Presently, studies suggesting its efficacy in treating autism are still experimental, and no definitive claims have been established. Therefore, like any alternative treatment, caution is advised when considering HBOT for autism. Caution While hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has demonstrated effectiveness for certain conditions like the flu and decompression sickness, its impact on individuals with autism remains unclear. Like any treatment, HBOT has associated side effects. Combined with the absence of conclusive evidence regarding its positive effects for autism, it is crucial to approach such treatments with caution and make informed decisions. Some reasons to exercise caution include: + Lack of Definitive Evidence: Scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of HBOT for autism is limited and inconclusive. The absence of well-designed, large-scale clinical trials makes it challenging to firmly establish the safety and effectiveness of HBOT for autism. + Heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Autism is a heterogeneous condition with a wide range of symptoms and underlying factors. Responses to HBOT can vary among individuals with ASD, making it difficult to predict outcomes or adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. + Risk of Adverse Effects: While generally considered safe, HBOT is not without risks. Adverse effects, such as ear barotrauma and sinus discomfort, can occur. The potential long-term effects of prolonged or repeated HBOT sessions for individuals with autism are not well understood. + Medical procedure and Financial Costs: HBOT requires a lot of sessions and can be expensive. It may also not be covered by health insurance for the treatment of autism due to its experimental nature. Families should carefully assess the financial implications and weigh potential benefits against costs. + Ethical Considerations: Offering HBOT for autism without conclusive evidence of efficacy raises ethical concerns. Families should be cautious about therapies making bold claims without robust scientific support. + Unregulated Clinics and Non-Medical Settings: Some facilities offer HBOT for autism outside rigorous clinical trials, and standards of care may vary. Treatment in reputable healthcare institutions with experienced professionals ensures safety and monitoring. In summary, caution is advised when considering HBOT for autism. Thoroughly understanding the current scientific evidence, potential risks, and the experimental nature of the treatment is essential. Consulting with healthcare professionals and participating in well-designed clinical trials, when available, can offer more guidance on the appropriateness of HBOT for individual cases.",

      "content": "::: {.callout-caution} MMS is not recommended for autism. It can have dangerous side effects. ::: Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) is a controversial substance promoted in alternative health circles. Marketed as a cure for various ailments, MMS is a combination of sodium chlorite and citric acid, creating chlorine dioxide. Advocates claim it can treat conditions like malaria, cancer, and even autism. However, its use is highly controversial and poses serious health risks. MMS and Autism MMS has been suggested as a remedy for autism, asserting its ability to alleviate symptoms and enhance well-being in individuals on the autism spectrum. It's essential to note that there is no scientific evidence supporting MMS for autism, and major health organizations strongly advise against its use. History Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) , found in 2006 by Jim Humble, has a controversial history, marked by its promotion as a supposed cure for various illnesses despite serious health risks associated with its use. Here's a brief overview of the history of MMS: + Origins in Water Purification: MMS is derived from sodium chlorite, a chemical used in some industrial applications, including water purification. It was first promoted by Jim Humble, a former Scientologist, who claimed to have discovered its health benefits during a mining expedition in South America. + Promotion as a Health Supplement: Jim Humble initially marketed MMS as a health supplement with the claim that it could cure numerous diseases, including malaria, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and more. He founded the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing to promote MMS as a sacrament. + Claims for Autism and Other Conditions: Over time, MMS gained attention as a purported treatment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental conditions. Despite lacking scientific evidence, some individuals and groups advocated for its use in the autism community, claiming improvements in symptoms. + Legal Actions and Warnings: Regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health agencies worldwide, raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of MMS. The FDA issued warnings about the potential dangers of consuming MMS, emphasizing its corrosive nature and adverse health effects. + Legal Challenges: Legal actions were taken against individuals and organizations promoting MMS as a cure for various illnesses. Authorities cracked down on the sale and distribution of MMS, emphasizing its lack of approval for medical use and the risks it posed to public health. + Global Controversy: MMS gained international attention and sparked controversy, with health agencies in multiple countries issuing advisories against its use. The substance became a focal point in debates about pseudoscience, unproven treatments, and the potential exploitation of vulnerable populations. + Continued Advocacy Despite Warnings: Despite widespread condemnation and legal actions, there are continued reports of individuals advocating for and using MMS. Online platforms have been used to disseminate information about MMS, leading to ongoing concerns about its accessibility and use. + Ethical Considerations: The promotion of MMS for serious medical conditions, including autism, raises ethical concerns within the medical and scientific communities. Advocates for evidence-based medicine emphasize the importance of protecting individuals from potentially harmful and unproven treatments. The controversy surrounding MMS underscores the importance of relying on evidence-based medical practices and the need for public awareness regarding potential health risks associated with unproven treatments. In addition, the popularity of MMS at one time as a remedy for autism should make us all weary of the power of zealous beliefs supported with religious fervor and no evidence. Caution: + Lack of Scientific Support: The endorsement of MMS as an autism treatment lacks scientific credibility. Rigorous clinical trials with proper controls and methodologies are absent, rendering any claims about its benefits for autism unproven. + Health Risks and Side Effects: MMS contains chlorine dioxide, an industrial chemical. Ingesting it can lead to severe health risks, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and potentially life-threatening complications. The Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the dangers of MMS consumption. + Ethical Concerns: Using MMS for autism raises ethical concerns, especially when targeting vulnerable populations like children with autism. Advocates for evidence-based medicine and ethical healthcare practices strongly caution against the use of unproven and potentially harmful substances. + Legal Implications: Due to health risks, the sale and distribution of MMS as a medical treatment face legal challenges. Regulatory authorities take actions to prevent its promotion for therapeutic purposes, highlighting the potential harm to public health. In conclusion, Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) lacks scientifically proven benefits for treating autism or any health condition. Its use is associated with significant health risks, and regulatory authorities strongly discourage its consumption. Individuals and families seeking interventions for autism are urged to prioritize evidence-based treatments and consult healthcare professionals for the well-being and safety of those with autism spectrum disorder.",

      "content": "::: {.callout-caution} Chelation is not recommended for autism. It can have dangerous side effects. ::: What is chelation? In chelation, the aim is to administer medications (chelators) that bind with metals in the body and remove it from the system via urine when the medicine itself is excreted. This has been useful to treat heavy metal toxicity. Most commonly used medications are dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). This treatment is typically administered intravenously or orally under medical supervision following a detailed baseline assessment of metal content in the system, usually with a urine test. History of chelation Chelation process dates back to 1935 when it was used as binding and extracting agent of calcium in the dyeing industry. The use of Chelation therapy in humans started between the 1950s and 1960s when it was used in patients with hypercalcemia and lead poisoning, consequently showing improvements in their cardiovascular condition. Since then it has been established as an effective treatment for lead poisoning or any heavy metal toxicity for that matter and as anticoagulants. Between 2002 and 2007, despite several warnings and prohibitions by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), chelation gained popularity in the U.S. for treating heart conditions and other health issues. However, due to its intensity and potential harmful side effects, it is strictly administered under medical supervision. In 1989, a \"Protocol for the Safe and Effective Administration of EDTA\" was established and later updated. This comprehensive protocol establishes strict criteria for patient selection and urges clinicians to conduct an initial assessment of renal function using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. It further emphasizes the continuous monitoring of renal function throughout a series of chelation treatments. Additionally, emergency procedures are outlined in case of adverse reactions during the process. Why was Chelation tried for autism? It gained attention in the context of autism due to concerns about heavy metal toxicity in the systems of individuals in the spectrum, but scientific research hasn't supported the theory that autism is caused by heavy metal toxicity. Some studies have suggested that children with autism may have higher levels of certain heavy metals in their systems, but the direct cause between heavy metal exposure and autism has not been established. One hypothesis that autism is caused due to exposure to heavy metals (mercury) through vaccines has been studied thoroughly and research suggests no causal link between vaccines and autism. Other theories of autism being caused due to intrauterine or environmental exposure to heavy metals is still under study and there is no established link as of now. On the other hand, scientific research investigating the effectiveness of chelation therapy for autism remains limited and inconclusive. Clinical trials investigating the impact of chelation on autism symptoms have shown mixed or inconclusive results, and many of these studies have methodological limitations. Caution Chelation therapy can be risky and has the potential for serious side effects such as hypocalcaemia (level of calcium in blood is too low), renal impairment and reported deaths. The presence of certain metals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, chromium, potassium, sodium, and zinc is essential to facilitate normal biological functioning of the human body. It is a cause for concern if there are lower or higher levels of these metals than what is required. It necessitates meticulous and supervised administration of medications to avoid excessive removal of metals. Medical organizations do not recommend chelation therapy for autism due to safety concerns. Some researchers also suggest that due to the greater risks associated with chelation compared to its efficacy as a treatment for autism, it is advisable to first establish a definitive causal link between heavy metals and autism. This approach emphasizes the need to first validate the relationship between heavy metal exposure and autism before further studying on chelation as a treatment. Therefore, it is crucial for anyone, whether medical professionals or families, considering chelation therapy to conduct a thorough baseline assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the treatment before proceeding with it. There is no medical organization that is in favor of using chelation therapy for autism.",

      "content": "Thinking about schooling When considering schooling and education options for their children on the autism spectrum, parents often start with: \"Can my child go to school?\" Sometimes this question is also phrased as a need - “my child needs to go to school. How will he get an education otherwise?” This seemingly simple thought opens the doors on a variety of questions and concerns that parents often struggle with. ::: {.callout-tip} Video Available This video is about making school choices for children on the autism spectrum. ::: The short answer to \"Can my child go to school?\" is yes, but the more important question is, “Should they, and if so, under what conditions?” It is important to note that it is not just about academic abilities. Readiness for school depends upon a wider set of prerequisite skills—communication (verbal or non-verbal), the ability to self-regulate, engage in social or learning routines with support, and manage transitions and the unpredictability that comes with a group setting. If these skills are still developing, a better question to ask is, “Will school help my child build these skills or will it overwhelm them?” However, before addressing this question, it's important to think about what schooling and education mean and how they are different. Education is the acquisition of knowledge through formal learning and instruction. In contrast, schooling pertains to obtaining an education within a formal school setup. This difference is important as it helps us move beyond mere attendance and focus on a comprehensive educational journey for children on the autism spectrum. While we are at a point to choose between the both, it is worthy to note that education is more important than schooling. Recognizing that traditional education systems may pose challenges for autistic children is important. Unlike neurotypical children, the learning experience for autistic children can be difficult within conventional educational frameworks. This realization sets the stage for reimagining education to better suit the unique needs of children with autism. In this section, we address a few questions, concerns and thoughts relating to education and schooling for children on the spectrum. For the purposes of this section, the children we are talking about are 5-11 year olds. What can School do? Schooling can ideally help the child in getting social exposure, opportunities for peer interaction, academic and cognitive stimulation and a structured environment for skill development. However, the child will be met with the advantages of going to a school only if they are supported, understood and included meaningfully. If a child is struggling to keep up with the demands, or facing social exclusion, the benefits of school may never materialize and it can cost the mental health of the child. Parents are often told or they believe that the child will learn from being around their peers by observing and imitating, which works wonders for many children, but the assumption may be flawed for children having challenges in imitation or understanding social cues. Autistic kids often lack imitation skills or they imitate without full understanding. They may copy speech or behavior, but may not comprehend the meaning or intent. As a parent, one has to examine and have clarity on: What are the skills we want them to learn? - Is it responding to a teacher, sharing, social interaction or just sitting in a group? What is the nature of each of these skills? - Is it something they’ll pick up naturally like walking or is it something that requires specified instructions like writing or reading? What is the nature of the learning process for the child? - Can the child learn from the environment or does the child require structured, step by step instructions? Here is an analogy to understand this better. Imagine you want to teach the child to swim. One can take two approaches to teaching swimming: Throw the child at the deep end of the pool and expect the child to start swimming as human bodies are naturally designed to swim. * Teach the child with guided instructions Now, with the first approach, some may learn, while others may struggle and panic. Similarly, putting a completely inexperienced driver in the driving seat of a car in the middle of traffic and leaving them to “figure it out” on the road can turn out to be extremely dangerous and irresponsible of the trainer too. Throwing them in the deep end or leaving them to \"figure it out\" might be what we end up doing to an autistic child, when we place them in a classroom without ensuring they understand the environment, they have the skills to participate meaningfully and that they are safe, seen and supported. This is not teaching, it is more of hoping. The downside of starting with a mainstream school without taking the child’s readiness into account can look like - struggle with meltdowns after school, identity confusion, anxiety, accepting bullying, etc. Autistic children are often expected to “fit in” with neurotypical norms, and many quickly learn to mask their difficulties or develop unhealthy coping behaviours in order to avoid being judged or excluded. These behaviours can be mistaken for successful adaptations but they are likely to take a toll on their mental health in the long run.",

      "content": "Readiness for school is often equated to chronological age or cognitive abilities. But for an autistic child, it is not just about the ABCs and 123s. School readiness involves a broader functional set of skills which help them navigate and benefit out of a group environment - being able to engage, communicate and learn in a shared space. School readiness in the child can look like: Being able to communicate their needs - communication doesn’t equate speech (Read more on speech vs. communication). Whether verbal or non-verbal, the child should have a reliable method of communication. It can be through speech or gestures or visuals or using assistive technology. It is important because it facilitates participation in class, seeking help and expressing discomfort, if any. Being able to handle separation from the primary caregiver - the child should be able to stay away from the caregiver for a period of time without significant distress. This can be built gradually with support. Ability to self-regulate or co-regulate - A packed school day full of transitions can get overwhelming for autistic children. They should be able to use calming strategies or be open to receiving help from adults to navigate challenges like waiting, turn taking or emotional ups and downs Ability to participate in a group - The child should be ready or be gradually supported to be a part of a shared space, among peers and adults. Apart from social interaction, group readiness also means ability to follow group rules and routines, managing the noise and navigating the social dynamics. Ability to access the learning - learning could be through visuals or by observing or even a small group (1:3) support, but the child should be able to access the learning i.e be receptive to the learning. Learning can be social skills or academics or functional skills. Prerequisite skills - preschool and primary school Preschools are often the first structured social environment a child is exposed to. For an autistic kid, this requires careful planning. The focus here again should not be solely on age, but the readiness. Key prerequisite skills include: Basic communication - the child should have a functional way to express their needs Separation tolerance - the child should be able to be away from the primary caregiver for a brief duration without extreme distress Tolerance for group settings - the ability to stay in a space with others without distress or disruptive behaviors Regulation - being able to regulate emotions with support Awareness of and interest in peers- ability to show interest in others even if not interacting as much. At the primary school level, the environment becomes more demanding. There is an expectation of sustained attention, task completion, and social cooperation. Understanding and following routines: the child should be able to follow structured daily routines with some predictability. Attention span: the ability to stay engaged in an activity for at least 10–15 minutes with adult support. Instruction comprehension: understanding simple one- or two-step instructions. Emotional regulation skills: cope with changes, handle sensory inputs, and seek help when distressed. * Academic foundations: Foundational academic skills have to be in place for a meaningful learning experience - recognition of letters, numbers, colors or at least emerging pre-academic skills.",

      "content": "Without the prerequisite skills, school can become a space of confusion and anxiety, hindering growth. However, readiness does not equate complete independence. Readiness includes components such as the capacity for the child to participate in a group with support, the presence of an environment that scaffolds their needs and a team that works collaboratively. Therefore, let the child lead the decision. The goal is not just school attendance. It also includes meaningful learning and development. Whether that happens in a classroom, in nature or at a kitchen table, the right path should fit your child’s current strengths, needs and comfort. The path need not be what is typical or expected. So the relevant questions is - will my child be able to learn the skills I hope he/she will learn if they go to school. If yes, then it makes sense to look for a school environment that supports these goals. The child should be in a position to deal with the social and cognitive demands of going to a school. If not, our next question can be: is going to school the only way to learn these skills? To which the answer is a firm no. The alternatives include: Mainstream school with support - shadow teachers or inclusive education aids, an Individualised Education Plan (IEP) driven integration with goals tailored to the child. Special Education Schools, where there is likely be focused attention and specialized curriculum to meet the needs of the child and an environment with reduced sensory overload. Alternate schools (Waldorff, Montessori etc) - schools that follow a different curriculum from the mainstream schools, it is more flexible with the sensory needs, mixed age groups and experiential learning. Homeschooling - parents or guardians take responsibility for the child’s learning outside of traditional school setting. It gives the space for specialised curriculum, targeted interventions and sensory accommodations. Socialization and peer interaction can be tailored to the child’s comfort level and interests. Parents can join hands with other neurodivergent families and create a homeschooling community including experts from the field. It requires a considerable amount of parent's time and effort, but allows for complete customisation of the child’s education plan to suit their strengths, interests and challenges. These alternatives can be temporary or long term based on the child’s evolving needs. These are not limiting opportunities, but ensures that the opportunities are appropriate, accessible and beneficial. School can be a wonderful place for growth, but only when the environment matches the child’s readiness and the learning process suits their way of processing the world. It is very important that the child is learning safely, authentically and with joy. What should children learn at this age? As parents find a suitable learning environment for the child, another related question is what should the child learn at this age. This can also be used to assess whether the environment chosen for the child is working or not. Here is a general understanding of the developmental goals during the early schooling (5-11 year olds) that is meaningful for the child’s growth. A learning environment is often seen as a place of learning to read, write and do math. While these are important, learning, especially at this young age, should include broader aspects for neurodivergent children. They need opportunities to learn how to relate to others, understand emotions, regulate oneself, build a sense of self and engage meaningfully with the world around them - growth across all developmental areas should be nurtured. Core developmental domains include: Physical development - gross motor and fine motor skills, body awareness and co-ordination and self-care routines Cognitive development - Problem solving and reasoning, exploration and curiosity, understanding cause and effect and foundational concepts - numbers, shapes, time, patterns, letters Communication and language development - expressing needs, feelings and thoughts, listening and following instructions, building vocabulary and using functional language, understanding social language (greeting, turn taking etc) Socio-emotional learning - recognising and understanding emotions, developing empathy and perspective taking, forming relationships, regulating emotions, beginning to advocate for their needs Executive functioning - Attention and focus, planning and task initiation, flexible thinking and impulse control Functional life skills - asking for help, participating in routines, transitioning between tasks, time management, personal hygiene and grooming, cleaning, eating, expressing needs Leisure skills - activities that children engage in for fun, relaxation and creative expression - games/ sports, art and craft, music, dance etc. Academically, pre-literacy (story listening, sound awareness, letter recognition), early numeracy (counting, comparing quantities, patterns), matching, sorting, categorizing and learning through play and experience Essentially, what matters is how a child learns more than what a child learns. A learning environment that honors play as a learning tool, especially for kids this age, promotes deep learning and engagement as play gives the opportunity for children to develop their problem solving, imagination and negotiation skills. Ultimately, the goal of early schooling should be to lay the foundation for a lifelong love of learning and connection. How does a learning environment look like Just like the child is assessed for readiness, it is important to look for an environment that supports the child’s growth. The learning space should be more than just a place of instructions and accommodations. Finding the best fit can be overwhelming, but rather than worrying if the school will take the child, a more empowering question to ask is “Does the school/ environment have what it takes to support my child? Is the school or environment prepared to support my child?” For an autistic child, it should be a space where they are understood, accepted and meaningfully included in the learning process.The following are some basic factors to look for: Neurodiversity awareness - An environment that understands neurodiversity must go beyond surface-level accommodations. It must embrace the diversity of brain types and recognise that autistic thinking, feeling, and learning are different and not necessarily deficient. Ask questions like: - Is neurodiversity a part of staff training or classroom conversations? - Are behaviours interpreted through a strengths-based lens, instead of being problematized? - Are children supported to self-advocate or express boundaries? A truly inclusive culture is likely to be visible in the language used around neurodivergence, the materials in the classroom, and the way the people in the environment approach neurodiversity. Meaningful inclusion - Inclusion in its real sense means that every child has access to learning, participation, and peer interaction in ways that work for them. Inclusion is not about just placing a child in the same room as everyone else and letting them be. Look for: - Teachers who differentiate instructions and use visual, kinesthetic, or play-based strategies. - Flexible seating, modified tasks, and support to participate in group routines, without forcing conformity. - A culture where differences are normalised and not hidden or masked. Inclusion does not mean expecting autistic children to imitate neurotypical peers at the cost of their own regulation or identity. It means adapting the environment so all children can learn and belong. Response to sensory and emotional needs - Many autistic children have challenges with sensory processing, transitions and emotional regulation. The school should see them as needs to be met with appropriate strategies rather than as a problem to be fixed. Some relevant questions are: - Is the environment flexible to sensory needs - are there quiet corners, or allowance of movement breaks? - How do teachers respond to emotional distress or shutdowns? Is co-regulation part of the approach? Are teachers equipped with calming strategies? - Are transitions between activities paced with visual schedules or routines to support predictability? Children shouldn't be expected to \"cope\" on their own. A responsive environment anticipates needs and is ready to support them rather than reacting to behaviours. Ongoing training for teachers and non-teaching staff - Inclusion without sensitisation is incomplete. In order to be inclusive, the environment requires prepared adults and a space that supports the child's way of being. Teachers are the foundation of a child’s school experience and every school that admits autistic children must commit to ongoing training for its staff. This should ideally include: - Fostering an understanding of autism and neurodivergence beyond clinical labels. - Familiarity and fluency in communication strategies like AAC, visual schedules, or gestures. - Training in regulation techniques like co-regulation, sensory support, and flexible expectations. - Training for non-teaching staff as well - transport workers, helpers, and administrative staff, so the entire school ecosystem feels safe and inclusive. Without proper training, autistic children are often misunderstood. Teachers, too, face stress and burnout when they’re not equipped to support neurodivergent students. Sensitisation is learning to recognise distress, respond with empathy, adapt communication, and create safe, inclusive spaces. It helps teachers understand children's behaviour as a way of communication, replacing control with connection. Curriculum that goes beyond academics - Autistic children may have unique learning pathways. Academic skills are only one part of a child’s development. One has to know whether the school values, focuses and supports holistic growth, which can look like the curriculum focusing on and including: - Physical development: fine motor, gross motor, and self-care routines. - Cognitive skills: improving problem-solving, understanding cause-effect, memory, and attention. - Social-emotional learning: recognising emotions, building relationships, coping with change. - Functional life skills: following routines, managing transitions, using tools (e.g., cutlery, bags, visual schedules). - Leisure skills: engaging in play, art, music, or other recreational activities that offer joy and regulation. A meaningful learning environment should support holistic development of the child, and not just the usual academic checklists. Some questions you can pose to the management to understand a learning environment that you are looking to place your child in are: What support systems are in place for neurodivergent learners? Is there any special educator or an inclusion expert on staff? How are the teachers trained to support emotional and sensory regulation? Can the curriculum be adapted to meet my child’s learning pace and style? What is your approach to behaviour - do you use reward/punishment systems, or do you look at underlying needs? Are there spaces for downtime or sensory breaks? How do you work with families to create individualised plans? Hence, it is not just about the child being ready for a shared learning space, but also finding a learning space that is ready for your child.",

      "content": "“Inclusion is not a destination, but an approach.” Inclusion is not about making autistic children less autistic. It does not operate from the belief that children will grow out of autism by being in an inclusive setup. It is also not just about the space - just because they are physically present in the space, does not mean a child is included. If they are physically present, but are not attended to emotionally or no facilitation of meaningful learning takes place, inclusion has failed in that space. Inclusion is often misunderstood as including children with special needs in a regular classroom. It goes deep beyond that, creating an environment where all the children irrespective of their neurological profile, physical ability, pace of learning, socioeconomic background, and any other differences, have equal access to the learning process and the curriculum being provided in the environment. It requires a fundamental shift in the system to remove barriers and meet the diverse needs of the children. Inclusive systems value the unique contributions students of all backgrounds bring to the classroom and allow diverse groups to grow side by side, to the benefit of all. An inclusive system is built on the belief that a diverse classroom enriches the learning experience. The classroom culture promotes belonging - where everyone feels accepted, understood and valued. It could also include adults from diverse backgrounds or neurological profiles. In practical terms, it means: Teachers are trained to work with children with various academic and other abilities The system recognises different learning styles and paces as well as different ways of participating The curriculum is flexible to adapt to different learners There is time, space and energy built into the syste, to provide the required support - visuals, support teachers, sensory spaces, small group learning settings, extra academic support, emotional support etc. etc to help children access learning in a way that would work for them The classroom culture promotes belonging - every child is participating, valued and accepted. The environment reflects diversity among the adults who shape the learning environment, including teachers, aides, administrators, and support staff. “Inclusivity is actually maintained when all members of a group are able to participate in its activities, which means, provisions made are considerate of all members and not just those from specific groups or, with special abilities, disabilities, and/or needs.” It's about making school a place where they can grow, learn, be themselves and feel respected. When classrooms/ systems are designed with multiple needs in mind, they become more flexible, compassionate, and effective learning environments for every student. Why is inclusion important? Inclusion in education promotes equity, belonging and social change. It ensures all the children regardless of their abilities or learning styles, have meaningful learning experiences. For children who might have otherwise been excluded, inclusive systems provide a safe space for authentic expression allowing the child to thrive in his/her own terms. Beyond the individual, inclusion enriches the entire ecosystem. It challenges stereotypes, reduces stigma and fosters empathy and collaboration among children and educators. In doing so, it paves the way to create a more just and equitable society, where differences are valued and not just accommodated. Supporting autism in the school Now that schools are being called upon to meaningfully include diverse children, the role of schools and teachers requires intention, preparation and commitment. How should the school approach and support the admission of an autistic kid into the environment? Before admission, schools should consider: Assessment of readiness from both sides - just as a child’s readiness is essential, so is the school's. Does the school have the capacity - resources, training, and flexibility to provide a meaningful learning experience for the child? Having a trained professional on board - Is there a professional on staff who will work with teachers to individualize instruction, adapt materials, and support the child’s specific needs? Facility to involve shadow teachers or give one to one support - some children benefit greatly from a dedicated support person to navigate through the school routine. This person would ideally serve as a bridge between the child, teacher, and peers. Clear criteria for admission - the criteria for admitting an autistic child should be clear and the school should ensure that adequate support is in place. If the school cannot support the child, the school should be honest with its limitations and if possible try building on the capacity to include the child Accommodations and flexibility - From sensory-friendly spaces and visual schedules to adapted assignments and adjusted expectations, schools must be ready to make accommodations not as exceptions, but as part of inclusive practice. Once admitted, the school holds certain minimum responsibilities towards the learning journey of the child to make it meaningful and supportive: Curating an IEP - An IEP is a roadmap tailored to the child’s goals, strengths, challenges, and supports required. It should be created in collaboration with the family and revised regularly. Regular meeting with parents - Parents and caregivers are experts in their child’s needs. Their involvement in setting goals and reviewing progress is essential. Sensitisation and training for staff - All teachers and staff should receive basic training in neurodiversity, sensory regulation, emotional support strategies, and inclusive classroom practices. Support for the teachers As a teacher, one can expect the following support to facilitate meaningful experience for an autistic child: Training in Inclusive Practices: understanding autism, communication styles, sensory processing, and behavior from a needs-based lens is foundational. Team Support: access to a special educator, therapist, or mentor with whom they can consult, plan, and troubleshoot. A collaborative team makes inclusion sustainable. Classroom adaptation: Inclusion often requires shifting the way a classroom works - incorporating visual supports, allowing movement breaks, using predictable routines, offering multiple ways to demonstrate learning, and being flexible with acceptable behaviors should be allowed. Reasonable Workload: teachers cannot be expected to carry all the emotional and logistical responsibility alone. Schools should ensure that classrooms are not overcrowded, that support staff are available, and that expectations are realistic. Video - 7 Essential Things Teachers Should Know Here is a video in which Tayzeem Rasool, an autistic adult, shares the 7 things he would like teachers to know about autism. - Each autistic is different. Their strengths and challenges also differ. - Routines and schedules are very helpful. - The sensorial experiences of children with autism might be a lot more or less. - Stimming can help autistic children, do not force them to stop. - Give clear and step-by-step instructions. - Provide time for the child to process the language. - Use visuals while communicating or interacting as much as you can. {{}} By investing in training, collaboration, and meaningful accommodations, schools can become spaces where autistic children are not just present, but are understood, supported, and empowered to learn in their own way. Video - Education for All - schooling issues in autism In the video below, Giselle Lobo, a special educator and head of inclusive education services at Sethu, Goa, addresses parents to help them understand what goes into making choices for finding the right school and to provide them with a few guidelines when it comes to selecting a school for their children. Here is a summry: making a decision where to place your child in which school to place your child is extremely difficult especially for parents of kids with autism in order to make the right choice as to which school you are going to admit your child into you have to have a very good understanding of your child - the level of skills that your child has in self-help, being able to follow instructions and play you also need to understand the background of the school does the school welcome children is it willing to be accommodative, modify curriculum and the environment to support your child you also need to be aware of the curriculum that your child will benefit from most a functional curriculum or an academic curriculum do you have the option to place your child in a mainstream school with a life skills resource room or an academic resource room and finally, be aware of the supports your child needs - a visual schedule, a shadow teacher, buddies, activity based instruction, and see if the school is willing to provide them {{}}",

      "content": "Homeschooling is increasingly considered by families of autistic children who seek a more individualized, supportive, and flexible approach to education. For some families, homeschooling is not a last resort, but a thoughtful, empowering choice. However, the decision to homeschool brings up important questions, apprehensions, and practical considerations. Common Apprehensions and Challenges include: Socialization: One of the major concerns could be that homeschooled children may have fewer opportunities to interact with peers, potentially impacting their social skills. This requires parents to be proactive in seeking out social opportunities through groups, clubs, or community events Parental Commitment: Homeschooling demands significant time, energy, and organizational skills from parents. Not all families have the flexibility or resources to dedicate themselves to full-time teaching and therapy integration Need for Expertise: Parents may feel unprepared to teach certain subjects or address specific learning needs. Accessing professional guidance, training, and support networks is crucial to overcome this challenge Potential for Isolation: Both the child and the parent can experience isolation if not connected with broader homeschooling or autism support communities. What is homeschooling and why might it be the better option?{.unnumbered} Homeschooling is not just replicating the structure of traditional school at home. Instead, it is an educational approach that can be highly personalized to a child’s strengths, interests, and needs. For autistic children, this often means adapting the pace, content, and environment to reduce stressors and maximize engagement. It can involve creative, real-world learning, integration of therapies, and flexibility in daily routines, rather than rigid adherence to a standard curriculum. It can be a better option because: Tailored Learning: Homeschooling allows parents to customize academic goals, lessons, teaching methods, and schedules to fit the child’s unique learning style and pace. This can be especially valuable for autistic children, whose needs may not be completely met in a mainstream classroom Reduced Sensory Overload: The environment can be better controlled to minimize sensory triggers, such as noise and bright lights, which are common in traditional schools and can be distressing for autistic children Integrated Therapies: Parents can seamlessly incorporate speech, occupational, or behavioral therapies into the daily routine, ensuring that therapeutic goals are consistently addressed alongside academic learning Safety and Comfort: Homeschooling provides a relatively safe space free from bullying, exclusion, or misunderstanding, allowing children to learn and express themselves without fear of judgement Flexible Socialization: While socialization is different from school, families can arrange playdates, group activities, and community outings that are positive and manageable for them and their child, rather than overwhelming. However, there are some prerequisites to be fulfilled for effective homeschooling: Time and Commitment: At least one adult should have the ability to dedicate consistent time to planning, teaching, and supporting the child’s learning and development Willingness to Learn: Parents must be open to learning about autism, teaching strategies, and curriculum adaptation, and to seeking help when needed Access to Resources: This includes curriculum materials, therapy providers, online learning platforms, and local homeschooling groups for support and guidance Structured, Supportive Environment: The home should offer a calm, organized space with routines that help the child feel secure and ready to learn. Getting Help from Outside{.unnumbered} For families considering or undertaking homeschooling, connecting with supportive communities and specialized programs can make a world of difference. There are spaces from where a family with an autistic child can seek help wherein they can receive professional support from experts - therapists, educators who can provide interventions and specialized instruction or therapy sessions; build a network with fellow families and form a community and share resources. Here are two examples of organizations we run, that offer structured, community-based support for neurodivergent children and their families: At Subodha, we are a close-knit community of parents, therapists, and educators working together to empower families. We believe in supporting parents to become active partners in their child’s learning and development. Family Training Program (FTP): We run an intensive three-month program where parents and children come together daily for half-day sessions. This immersive experience strengthens the parent-child bond and equips families with practical skills to support their child’s growth and learning at home. It also helps families decide if they want to continue with Subodha’s community-based programs. Homeschool Groups: For families who want to homeschool but seek guidance and structure, we facilitate small groups of parents and children. Our senior therapists and educators collaborate with parents to design individualized learning plans tailored to each child’s needs. We provide ongoing support for day-to-day teaching, creating a flexible yet structured environment that blends the best of home and school. Afterschool and Intensive Support: We offer after-school sessions focusing on academics, social skills, and daily living, as well as half-day intensive programs for children needing one-on-one support. These options can complement homeschooling or support children attending mainstream schools. At Farmhill learning community, we are a neurodiverse, close-to-nature learning community where autistic and neurotypical children learn side by side, supported and respected for who they are. Inclusive Philosophy: We believe education should adapt to the child, not the other way around. Our approach honors neurodiversity and focuses on building understanding, confidence, and joy in learning. Community and Continuity: Farm Hill is not just a school; it’s a community where families, teachers, therapists, and children live and learn together. This continuity allows us to provide consistent, holistic support that integrates education, therapy, and family life. Rooted in Experience: Our founders, Venu and Chitra, started this journey after their own experiences navigating autism and education. Their vision guides us to create spaces where children are not forced to fit a mold but are empowered to grow authentically. Support for Homeschooling famlies at Subodha and Farmhill{.unnumbered} - We provide professional guidance through our team of therapists and educators who help parents craft and adapt individualized learning plans. - We foster a community connection, so families don’t feel isolated but instead share experiences, resources, and encouragement. - We offer flexible support options—from full-time homeschooling groups to afterschool enrichment and therapy—that can be tailored to each family’s needs and schedules. - By working closely with families, we help create learning journeys that are meaningful, sustainable, and centered on the child’s unique strengths and challenges.",

      "content": "Recognizing that learning is about more than academics (encompasses emotional, social, functional, and joyful growth), families naturally ask: What is the right educational setting for my child right now? Very often, this question is posed as a choice between early intervention and schooling. For many parents of neurodivergent children, especially between ages 4 and 8, this question can feel overwhelming. The encouraging truth is that there isn’t just one right answer. What matters most is choosing what helps your child thrive, not just survive. Early Intervention Versus Schooling: How to Choose for Children Aged 4–6{.unnumbered} As schools increasingly commit to meaningful inclusion, families of autistic children aged 4–6 often face a crucial decision: should they continue with early intervention services or transition their child into a formal school environment? This choice can feel overwhelming, but understanding the purpose and benefits of each approach can help guide families toward what is best for their child. What Is Early Intervention?{.unnumbered} Early intervention refers to specialized therapies and supports—such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral interventions, and family training—delivered as early as possible, often starting at age two or three. These services are designed to address developmental delays and help children build foundational skills in daily living, communication, and social interaction - regulation, play, and connection; readiness for later learning - skills such as attention, regulation, interaction, and communication. If your child is still developing these, early intervention through therapists, play-based programs, or home support is often more beneficial than prematurely placing them in a structured academic setting. Research shows that starting integrated developmental and behavioral interventions as soon as autism is diagnosed or suspected can have major long-term positive effects. The early years are a period of rapid brain development, making intervention especially effective at this stage. Research consistently shows that children who receive early intervention are more likely to experience significant progress in language, cognitive, and adaptive skills, and in some cases, may see a reduction in autism symptoms over time. What Does (or should) Schooling Offer?{.unnumbered} Formal schooling, including preschool and kindergarten, introduces children to structured routines, group learning, and socialization with peers. Schools can provide Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), accommodations, and access to a team of professionals. For some children, this environment fosters academic readiness, independence, and social growth. When schools are prepared with trained staff, sensory-friendly spaces, and the flexibility to adapt teaching methods, autistic children can thrive and participate meaningfully alongside their peers, provided the child is school ready. How to Decide: Key Considerations{.unnumbered} Child’s Individual Needs and Readiness - If your child is still developing basic communication, social, or self-help skills, early intervention may be the most appropriate focus. These services are highly individualized and often involve parents as partners in therapy. If your child is showing readiness for group activities, can follow simple routines, and benefits from peer interaction, school may be a positive next step, especially if the school is equipped to provide the necessary support. School’s Capacity and Support - Before enrollment, assess whether the school has trained professionals, the ability to individualize instruction, and a willingness to provide accommodations. If the school cannot offer adequate support, it may be best to continue with early intervention while working with the school to build capacity for future inclusion. Blending Both Approaches - For many families, a combination works best. Children might attend school for part of the day and receive therapies outside of school hours. This blended approach allows for continued skill-building through intervention while benefiting from the social and academic experiences that school provides. As parents make these decisions, they can sonsult with developmental pediatricians, therapists, and educators. Comprehensive evaluations can help determine whether your child is ready for school or would benefit from continued early intervention. Need not be mutually exclusive{.unnumbered} Early intervention and schooling are not mutually exclusive; the right choice depends on your child’s current developmental stage and the quality of available support at school. Early intervention is critical for building foundational skills and can have lasting positive effects, especially when started as soon as autism is diagnosed or suspected. Schooling offers opportunities for socialization and academic growth, but only if the child is ready and the environment is prepared and supportive. Many families find a gradual transition, or a combination of both, helps their child reach their fullest potential. Ultimately, the decision should be guided by your child’s unique needs, the readiness and resources of the school, and ongoing input from professionals and your family. Starting early, staying flexible, and advocating for the right support will give your child the best chance to thrive. Pushing children through mainstream school Inclusion in mainstream schools is a right, but meaningful inclusion requires more than simply placing neurodivergent children—autistic, ADHD, or otherwise—into classrooms and hoping they will cope. Too often, children who appear quiet, compliant, or academically able are left to \"manage\" in environments that are not prepared or willing to meet their needs. When we ignore the nuanced support these children require and push them through the system because they seem to be coping, the consequences are profound and long-lasting. Initial Challenges: The Invisible Struggle{.unnumbered} Many autistic children who are kept in mainstream classrooms are there not because they are thriving, but because they are not disruptive. Their quietness is mistaken for adjustment, but in reality, it often reflects withdrawal and disengagement. These children can become almost invisible—present in body but not in spirit or participation. Their relationships with teachers and peers may be minimal or non-existent, and they are often left to navigate the day with little meaningful interaction. When they come to therapy, it becomes clear how much they have regressed—skills they once had fade, and even basic communication can become a struggle. The classroom often expects little of them, and so they get away with giving the bare minimum effort, reinforcing a cycle of passivity and isolation. Emotional and Social Fallout{.unnumbered} Even for those who manage to keep up with academics and avoid behavioral concerns, the emotional toll is significant. Mainstream settings, without adequate support, rarely address the emotional regulation needs of autistic students. Social nuances and feedback from peers and teachers become a confusing maze, and without guidance, these misunderstandings accumulate. The result is often emotional overload: sudden outbursts, meltdowns, or shutdowns, sometimes surfacing in school, sometimes saved for therapy or home. The pain of not being understood, of feeling different but unable to express it, can linger for years. Many autistic children and young adults recount experiences of bullying, exclusion, and invalidation in mainstream schools, leading to anxiety, depression, and a fractured sense of self. Cognitive Gaps and the Illusion of Progress{.unnumbered} Academically \"bright\" children in primary school may still develop significant gaps in understanding as they progress. Autistic students often excel at pattern recognition, rote learning, and multiple-choice tests, but these strengths can mask deeper difficulties with abstraction and concept formation. As the curriculum becomes more abstract in middle and high school, these gaps widen. Extra tuition and relentless academic focus do little to address the underlying issues; instead, learning becomes mechanical and disconnected from real understanding. The child may pass exams, but the knowledge is superficial, and the process of learning loses meaning. Life Skills and Independence: The Forgotten Curriculum{.unnumbered} When the focus is solely on academic achievement, essential life skills are neglected. Planning, organizing, self-care, and independent decision-making fall by the wayside. By the time these students finish school, many cannot manage basic daily tasks or initiate activities on their own. Parents, in their anxiety to ensure academic success, often continue to micromanage, unintentionally impairing independence. The result is young adults who may know how to cook or organize in theory but never take initiative, remaining passive observers in their own lives. Long-Term Consequences: Case Reflections{.unnumbered} The stories of young adults who were pushed through mainstream school without adequate support are sobering. One young man with ADHD, after years of bottling up stress, experienced a complete breakdown and refused to continue his education. Another, a bright autistic adult, passed exams but never developed the social or emotional skills needed for adult life, struggling with unemployment, isolation, and emotional dysregulation. Both cases highlight how academic success, in the absence of holistic support, can leave neurodivergent individuals unprepared for life beyond school—emotionally, socially, and practically. The Cost of Invalidation and Missed Communication{.unnumbered} Mainstream schooling, when not thoughtfully adapted, often prioritizes compliance and correctness over acceptance and genuine connection. Casual conversation—the foundation of social bonds and self-expression—is rarely nurtured, leading to a \"deficit of conversation\" that follows autistic individuals into adulthood. When children cannot communicate their discomfort or needs, they experience deep invalidation and distress. Parents, fearing non-compliance, may become overprotective, further limiting opportunities for independence and self-advocacy. A Call for Meaningful Engagement{.unnumbered} The lesson is clear: simply expecting children to \"do it quietly\" or fit in is not the answer. True inclusion means going beyond visible problems and academic performance to foster emotional regulation, communication, and self-worth. It means creating environments where neurodivergent children are not just present, but genuinely understood, valued, and supported to develop all aspects of their identity and not just their test scores. a mix of approaches Last but not the least, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking in absolutes: school versus homeschooling, therapy versus academics, mainstream versus special education, but real-life experiences and research show that the most effective support often comes from blending different approaches, adapting as the child grows and circumstances change. Every autistic child is unique. Their strengths, challenges, and preferences can shift over time and also the family’s state of affairs. What works brilliantly one year may need adjustment the next. Rather than forcing a child into a single educational model, families and educators are encouraged to remain flexible, open-minded, and creative in finding what works best for the child and the family at any given moment. Blending Approaches: What Does It Look Like?{.unnumbered} Combining School and Therapy: Many children attend school part-time and receive therapies (speech, occupational, behavioral) outside of school hours. This ensures academic progress while continuing to build foundational skills. Integrating Home and Community Learning: Homeschooling families often supplement with community classes, playgroups, or therapy sessions, creating a rich, varied learning environment. Using Multi-Sensory and Cross-Disciplinary Methods: Schools and families can incorporate multi-sensory activities—engaging sight, sound, touch, and movement—to enhance learning and participation. Cross-disciplinary teams, including teachers, therapists, and parents, collaborate to support the child holistically. Flexible Socialization: Social skills can be developed in many settings—school, therapy groups, community activities, or even online. The key is to find environments where the child feels safe and motivated to connect with others. It’s perfectly normal to try different options and make changes as needed. Some families start with early intervention, move to mainstream school, then shift to homeschooling for a period, and later reintegrate into group settings. The goal is not to “pick the right path” once and for all, but to respond thoughtfully to the child’s evolving needs and circumstances. No matter the mix, success depends on strong communication between families, educators, and professionals. Regularly reviewing what’s working and what isn’t ensures that support remains relevant and effective. Involving the child in these conversations, when possible, can also empower them and respect their preferences. Conclusion There is no single “correct” way to educate or support an autistic child. The most meaningful progress happens when families and schools are willing to blend, adapt, and innovate—always putting the child’s well-being and growth at the center and prioritizing what is working for the family. By moving beyond binaries and embracing a mix of approaches, we give every child the best chance to thrive, learn, and find joy in their unique journey.",

      "content": "Identifying Autism Autism is a neurodevelopmental variation. The most effective way to support autistic people is through understanding, acceptance, and providing individualized supports and accommodations. Early identification can help families and communities better understand and support autistic individuals. However, autism is a spectrum condition, so the symptoms may vary in type and severity from child to child. In addition, since each child develops in his/her own way, some early signs of autism look like they are part of the natural development of the child. Also, Indian families often tend to think that speaking a little late, being a little unresponsive, is nothing to worry about. One often hears things like \"oh, his father spoke at three, look he is all fine now!\" and \"boys start speaking late anyway\". All of this makes early identification and action difficult for parents. Other family members and friends tend to keep their peace till the child is older. Most medical professionals may also advise a wait and watch approach. While autism can look different in different children, the most common areas of difference are communication and interaction with others. Signs of autism can be noticed when the children are around 2-3 years of age or even earlier. Parents and caregivers may watch for these signs. Throughout this document, we use identity-first language (such as “autistic person” or “autistic child”), in keeping with the preferences of many in the autistic community. However, we recognize and respect that some individuals may prefer person-first language. We also strive to be neurodiversity affirming in our approach.",

      "content": "When you notice any of the following signs in the children around you, it is useful to consult a developmental psychologist or a developmental pediatrician at the earliest. It is possible that these signs do not mean autism, but if they do, then you would have recognized these differences a little earlier and started providing support, thereby helping the child access resources and understanding sooner. Differences in reaching developmental milestones Autistic children may show some early signs of being on the spectrum, such as reaching developmental milestones on their own timeline or engaging differently with their environment (these vary for each child). + Does not respond to name by 9 months of age + Does not show facial expressions like happy, sad, angry, and surprised by 9 months of age + Does not play simple interactive games like pat-a-cake by 12 months of age + Uses few or no gestures by 12 months of age (for example, does not wave goodbye) + Does not share interests with others by 15 months of age (for example, shows you an object that they like) + Does not point to show you something interesting by 18 months of age + Does not notice when others are hurt or upset by 24 months of age + Does not notice other children and join them in play by 36 months of age + Does not pretend to be something else, like a teacher or superhero, during play by 48 months of age + Does not sing, dance, or act for you by 60 months of age Communication differences About 40% of autistic children do not use spoken language, and between 25% and 30% develop some language skills during infancy but then communicate differently as they grow. Some autistic children start using spoken language later in life, or may use alternative forms of communication. Many autistic children communicate in ways that differ from neurotypical expectations, including: + Does not give or sustain eye contact + Delayed speech and language skills + Flat, robotic speaking voice, or singsong voice + Echolalia (repeating the same phrase over and over) + Reversal of pronouns (saying “you” instead of “I,” for example) + Not using or rarely using common gestures (pointing or waving), and not responding to them + Does not stay on topic when talking or answering questions + Not recognizing sarcasm or joking + Trouble expressing needs and emotions + Not getting signals from body language, tone of voice, and expressions Repetitive behaviors and focused interests Autistic people may have unique ways of engaging with the world, such as focusing deeply on particular interests or using repetitive movements to self-regulate. Examples of repetitive behaviors and focused interests that are common among autistic people can include: + Lines up toys or other objects and gets upset when order is changed + Plays with toys the same way every time + Is focused on parts of objects (for example, wheels) + Has strong preference for routines + Has focused interests + Flaps hands, rocks body, or spins self in circles + Has unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel + Has strong likes and dislikes with respect to food + Differences in coordination and movement + Acting quickly or impulsively + Expressing distress through strong emotions or actions + Varied attention spans Other Characteristics Many autistic people may also experience other characteristics, such as: + Differences in cognitive or learning skills + Hyperactive, impulsive, and/or inattentive behavior + Co-occuring conditions like Epilepsy or seizure disorder + Unique eating and sleeping habits + Gastrointestinal issues (for example, constipation) + Distinct emotional reactions + Experiences of anxiety, stress, or excessive worry + Differences in experiencing and expressing fear Autistic people often have unique strengths, such as deep focus, creativity, attention to detail, and passionate interests. Recognizing and valuing these qualities helps build a more inclusive and supportive community.",
