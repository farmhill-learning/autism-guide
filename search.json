    "text": "People and Organizations involved\nThe idea of a comprehensive guide for special needs populations in India started out as a shared thought between Azim Premji Foundation and a few partners working in special needs space. Farmhill Learning Community has been involved in the ideation and design, and is currently responsible for creating and maintaining this guide to autism.\nAt farmhill, we have been working with autism for about 15 years. Through farmhill education trust, we have been running sambhavam, an early intervention center, Farm Hill Learning, a neurodiverse, close to nature, learning community as well as subodha, a homeschool support center. This guide has evolved largely out of our experience of living with autism, and working with people on the spectrum and their families.\nWe are also glad to have access to the resources and thinking developed over the years at Action for Autism a not for profit organization that pioneered the autism movement in South Asia; ummeed, founded in 2001 by Dr Vibha Krishnamurthy, one of India’s first developmental pediatricians, as a not-for-profit organization with the vision of helping children with and at risk of developmental disabilities reach their full potential and be included in society; and sethu, a charitable trust based in Goa, which helps children get the best out of their lives as they grow and develop. Between them, we have the support of the best organizations working in the autism space in India.\nWe are thankful to Azim Premji Foundation for the support at various levels. This guide would not have seen the light of the day without the involvement and unstinting support of highly dedicated people at APF.\nWhile we have the support of these wonderful organizations, and the community at farm hill, the key people actively working to put this guide here are - venu GVGK, Chithra Seshadri and the team comprising Nethra Parthiban, Nandana U and Chandu. Needless to say, all the errors are ours.\nPlease use the comment box available on each article page to let us know your thoughts. You can also email Venu directly on venu.gvgk@gmail.com.",

The rest of the guide elaborates on the points of view presented in this section.\nNext, we outline a history of autism, starting from early definitions and trace the path down to various developments in understanding and dealing with autism. This section would be of interest to those who want to understand the origins of various thoughts and perspectives associated with autism.\nThen we discuss how to identify autism, how common it is, what causes and what does not cause autism. We address the vaccine question (no, there is no evidence), and also present a brief timeline of various causes of autism - most of which have proven to be wrong or of limited understanding.\nIn the next section, we present perspectives of people living with autism, including people on the spectrum, families living with autism, medical professionals, and social workers. We attempt to cover the life cycle of autism by including perspectives from different groups.\nThen we address the diagnosis process starting from the need to diagnosis to the actual process of getting a diagnosis. We also include diagnosis for older people.\nIn the next two sections, we outline the immediate steps a family can take when they receive a diagnosis and proceed to explore various approaches to early intervention.\nWe then strike a cautionary note as we talk about alternative approaches to autism that are consider ineffective and sometimes, dangerous. This is done to ensure we provide all the necessary information.\nThen we proceed to education and schooling, where we examine the goals and approaches to education and schooling in the Indian context.\nThe next section covers employment where we outline how people on the spectrum can train for work. We also provide some resources that can help them find and keep work.\nThe final section deals with being an adult on the spectrum.",

    "text": "1.1 The onset of Autism\nAutism is a natural variation in how people’s brains work and experience the world. Autistic people may communicate, interact, and process information in ways that differ from the neurotypical majority. Because autism exists on a spectrum, each autistic person has their own unique strengths, challenges, and ways of engaging with their surroundings. Rather than viewing these differences as deficits, the neurodiversity perspective recognizes and values the diverse ways that brains can function and contribute to society.\nThroughout this document, we use identity-first language (such as “autistic person” or “autistic child”), in keeping with the preferences of many in the autistic community. However, we recognize and respect that some individuals may prefer person-first language.\nAutism in children usually becomes noticeable around the age of 2 to 3 years, all though with increasing awareness, early identification is becoming more common these days.\nParents may first notice that their child engages with the world in unique ways. Some autistic children might communicate or play differently, such as not always responding to their name, making eye contact, or using spoken words in the same way as their peers. They may have distinct interests and find joy in activities that are meaningful to them, like watching fans spin, flapping their hands, rocking, singing, or arranging objects in specific patterns.\nSome autistic children experience the world in ways that make transitions or unexpected changes particularly challenging. When routines are disrupted or sensory input becomes overwhelming, they may use strategies like focusing inward, seeking comfort in familiar activities, or engaging in repetitive movements—such as hand-flapping, rocking, or arranging objects—to self-regulate and manage their environment. These behaviors are meaningful ways for autistic children to cope with sensory overload or to express their needs, even if they look different from those of their peers.\nParents might notice these differences in how their child interacts, communicates, or responds to their surroundings. Seeking support from professionals such as developmental pediatricians or psychologists can help families better understand their child’s unique sensory and communication needs and access resources that foster acceptance, comfort, and growth.",

    "text": "1.3 What does it mean for the parents, the child and family?\nThe immediate implication of autism diagnosis for the parents is that they need to rethink their ideas of parenting and their expectations of the child. Children on the spectrum may have various neurological and physiological differences that cause them to experience the world very differently from other people. Parents need to be willing to learn about their child and how their autism works. They need to be open to learning about various therapies and educational approaches in order to learn to support themselves and the child.\nIn the Indian context, where support from public institutions may be limited, a diagnosis of autism for the child may require the parents to radically rethink their lifestyle and goals. They may need to plan their lives such that one of the parents is available to support the child and coordinates with the doctors, therapists, school and other people who interact with the child.\nWhile families may face challenges as they learn to support their autistic child, many also discover new perspectives, joys, and strengths within their family as they embrace neurodiversity and celebrate their child’s unique qualities.",

    "text": "1.4 What is the way forward?\nOnce there is a diagnosis, the next thing to do is to think of various ways to start supporting the child. This usually takes the form of therapies - behavior therapies to start learning to understand and respond to the general behavior of the child; speech and language therapy to help open a channel of communication; occupational therapy or physical activities to help the child with physical regulation. The specific things that are done in each of the therapies depend on the specific strengths and needs of the child.\nWhichever of these therapies are chosen, one needs to ensure the therapies are aimed at making life easier for the child and the family. The goal of these supports is not to change who the child is, but to help them access opportunities, build on their strengths, and participate fully in their community.Over a period of time, the therapies are supposed to build the skills and competencies of the child, show the family how to support the child, and over all, add to the quality of life of the family.\nIt also helps if parents continue to be involved in the therapies, understand the processes and learn the basic approaches, so that the child gets the same support whenever s/he needs it. It is important that any therapies or supports chosen are respectful of the child’s autonomy and preferences, and are never aimed at suppressing harmless autistic traits, but rather at empowering the child to thrive in their own way.",

Every autistic person has their own unique strengths, challenges, and ways of experiencing the world. As the saying goes, “If you’ve met one autistic person, you’ve met one autistic person.”\nSome autistic people may have differences in coordination, communication, or motor planning, while others may also experience co-occurring conditions such as epilepsy, anxiety, intellectual disability, or depression. Each person’s needs and experiences are unique, and support strategies should be tailored to the individual.\nFamilies may sometimes find it challenging to navigate the various supports, therapies, and educational approaches available, especially in contexts where resources are limited. This can also impact the family’s ability to socialize and connect with their community, and they may encounter barriers or misunderstandings from others.\nAs autistic children grow into teenagers and young adults, it is important for families and communities to continue learning, adapting, and supporting their evolving needs and identities. In India, there is a need for more inclusive opportunities and support systems for autistic individuals beyond childhood, including meaningful educational, vocational, and social options for teens and adults.\nAs autistic individuals grow, supporting their self-advocacy and listening to their voices becomes increasingly important.

Many autistic adults benefit from supportive environments, understanding communities, and accommodations that help them manage sensory, social, or emotional differences. It’s important to recognize that needing support is not a reflection of someone’s value or potential, but simply a part of human diversity.\nIn India, opportunities and resources for autistic adults are still growing.

    "text": "2.1 Autism – Initial definition and refrigerator mother hypothesis\nWhy is the history of autism important? Why is the history of any scientific idea important, for that matter?\nThe history of a scientific idea is important because science develops in the context of the challenges faced in a particular time and place. People who are doing science do not work in a vacuum, so what they notice and the way they interpret what they see, both depend on the context in which they are operating. However, when these interpretations become part of the science, they are sometimes seen to be somehow ‘objective’ by later day practitioners and students. This leads to a loss of context and inhibits the ability to critically examine older ideas, thereby giving them a longer life than they deserve.\nNowhere is this more visible than in the case of autism.\nThe acknowledged pioneer of autism research in the US was also the proponent of the claim that ‘refrigerator mothers’ caused autism. He focused on one specific end of the autism spectrum, ended up conveying the idea that it is a severely disabling, rare condition, and that led to a certain stigma around autism.\nAnother pioneer of autism, while he had a better understanding of the variety of autistic traits, had to focus on the ‘higher functioning’ end of the spectrum, as he worked in the Nazi regime that did not have a place for the ‘feeble minded’.\nWhile both are Germanic, they wrote in two different languages making it difficult to reconcile these two ideas. Both failed to acknowledge the work of brilliant clinicians, who, incidentally, worked with one first and then with the other.\nBoth might also have known about but ignored the seminal contributions of a Soviet Jewish woman psychologist, possibly due to antisemitism, sexist attitudes, and anti-Soviet sentiments. These contributions, if accounted for properly, would have made autism what it is today, but much earlier and with much less misery all around.\nComing a little later, a parent of an autistic child, who worked tirelessly to disprove ‘refrigerator mother’ theory was also a supporter of controversial programs and alternative treatments like chelation, use of aversive and believed in the vaccine-autism link which was later discredited.\nThen it took a British woman psychiatrist, also the mother of a severely autistic child, to bring these accounts together and help us see autism for the spectrum it is. It took the accounts of a few autistic adults like Temple Grandin and Judy Singer, movies like Rainman, the recent tireless work of journalists like Steve Silberman, as well as countless others, to put the idea of neurodiversity as the basis of looking at and understanding autism, as we do today.\nSo, yes, the history of autism is interesting and informative. Let’s dive in for more detail!\nKanner’s perspective on autism, as an infrequent and narrowly defined condition, influenced perceptions for years, contributing to precise diagnosis but potentially hindering a broader understanding of the spectrum.\nOur understanding of autism has undergone significant evolution, shaped by both early observations and subsequent scientific advancements. Initially, the term “autism” was coined by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1908, describing symptoms observed in schizophrenia as a withdrawal into an inner world or self-absorption. Leo Kanner, born in Austria in 1894, later became a key figure in defining and shaping the early understanding of autism.",

His influential work began in 1928 when he underwent psychiatric training and eventually joined John Hopkins University Hospital. Kanner’s contributions included establishing a child psychiatric unit, transforming the doctor-patient relationship perspective. In 1935, he authored “Child Psychiatry,” the first English-language textbook on the subject. During this time, he helped clinicians Anne Weiss and George Frankl to escape the Nazi regime in Germany. Frankl later joined Kanner at John Hopkins University.\nIn 1941, Kanner presented a paper titled “Autistic Disturbances with Affective Contact,” which was eventually published in 1943. This seminal work outlined observations of 11 children with common signs, including social isolation, a desire for sameness, routine obsession, delayed echolalia, and splinter memory skills. Kanner’s perspective on autism, as an infrequent and narrowly defined condition, influenced perceptions for years, contributing to precise diagnosis but potentially hindering a broader understanding of the spectrum.\nKanner proposed the concept of emotionally neglectful mothers (refrigerator mothers) in his observations of parents of children with autism.

Lovaas highlighted the importance of early intervention, acknowledging that addressing language deficits during early development could positively impact overall communication abilities in children with autism.\nHis study employed a data-driven approach, prioritizing the collection and analysis of objective data to evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral interventions. This commitment to empirical research became foundational to the scientific approach characteristic of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), which Lovaas and his colleagues further developed in the 1980s.\nWhile the 1965 study focused on language development, it set the stage for Lovaas’s comprehensive approach to autism treatment. Continuing his research and developing the Lovaas Method in the 1980s, he contributed to establishing ABA as a prominent, evidence-based intervention for individuals with autism.\nABA involves breaking down complex behaviors into smaller components and using reinforcement strategies to encourage desired behaviors while discouraging undesirable ones. The Lovaas Method features intensive one-on-one behavioral therapy, often exceeding 40 hours per week, with a focus on structured learning, positive reinforcement, and individualized goals. Grounded in empirical research, Lovaas’s work, including the 1987 study “Behavioral treatment and normal educational and intellectual functioning in young autistic children,” played a crucial role in establishing ABA as a leading intervention for autism.",

    "text": "2.5 Study of autism in twins – Investigating genetic origins - 1977\nThe study’s significance lies in shifting the perception of autism from an environmentally caused disorder to one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders.\nA few years down the line, despite Bernard Rimland’s efforts to challenge the refrigerator mother theory, the concept resurfaced in 1967, perpetuated by Bruno Bettelheim, a psychoanalyst who echoed and popularized the theory in his book titled “The Empty Fortress.”\nA significant turning point came with the first-ever study of twins and autism in the history of autism research, providing an alternative perspective to blaming parents. Previous studies had noted a lack of resemblance for non-twin siblings, challenging the consideration of genetic influence on autism. The rarity of autism diagnoses at the time (2-4 children out of 10,000) contributed to the low rates observed in siblings, even if heritability were high.\nThe groundbreaking study conducted by Susan Folstein and Michael Rutter focused on 21 pairs of British twins, examining the concordance rates for autism. They studied identical twins (monozygotic), where a fertilized egg splits and develops into two babies with the same genetic information, as well as non-identical twins (fraternal or dizygotic) where two eggs are fertilized by two sperm and produce two genetically unique children.\nAmong the 10 pairs of fraternal (dizygotic, DZ) twins, where at least one twin was diagnosed with autism using strict criteria, not a single co-twin was diagnosed with autism, indicating zero concordance for fraternal twin pairs.\nThe most striking result emerged from the 11 pairs of identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins, genetically identical as clones. Among these pairs, 4 (36%) were concordant for strictly diagnosed autism. The researchers used case histories from interviews with parents and observations of the 42 children, maintaining blindness to whether the children were members of identical or fraternal twin pairs.\nThe study’s significance lies in shifting the perception of autism from an environmentally caused disorder to one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders. As molecular genetic research advanced in the 1980s, autism became a prominent target. However, Folstein and Rutter anticipated that genetic influence on autism might result from multiple genes of small effect size, explaining the challenges in identifying specific genetic culprits.\nThe 1977 paper not only contributed to understanding the heritability of autism but also made additional discoveries that continue to shape the research agenda for autism, particularly in refining the diagnosis of autism.",

Her work has had a lasting impact on autism research, diagnosis, and support systems.\nDr. Lorna Wing (1928-2014) trained as a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry. She and her husband John Wing both specialized as psychiatrists. They had a daughter Susie in 1956. Susie was delayed in development and had a ‘detached, insular’ manner. Despite being specialists in psychiatry, it took them years to get a diagnosis of autism. Convinced of the need for more research in the space, Dr. Wing changed her focus to child psychiatry. Dr. Wing and her collaborator Dr. Judith Gold did pioneer work in the field of autism. They initiated Camberwell Case register to record all patients using psychiatric services in that area of London and relentlessly accumulated case data that formed the basis of the influential insight that autism formed a spectrum.\nIn 1981, she published a paper titled ‘Asperger syndrome: A clinical account’, popularizing the research of Hans Asperger. Asperger was an Austrian psychiatrist who, in 1940s, described a form of autism in a group of intelligent boys who were intensely interested in one or two subjects like dinosaurs or trains. They shared many of the usual problems associated with autism like the inability to make friends, repetitive behaviors, and distress at any change in routines.\nDr. Wing presented Asperger’s paper, along with her own research, as strong evidence for her larger argument that autism should be understood as a spectrum of disorders sharing common roots. At one end are some who, like Dr. Asperger’s patients, would go on to successful careers and untroubled lives, at the other end, may be patients like those studied by Dr. Kanner.\nWho was Hans Asperger and how did his research not see the light of day till 1980s, while stigmatizing ideas of autism were around for about 40 years?",

    "text": "2.8 Hans Asperger – the other end – 1944\nHans Asperger (1906-1980), an Austrian pediatrician born in Vienna. He pursued medicine and received his medical degree in 1931 from the University of Vienna. He joined the University Children’s Clinic in Vienna. His mentor and supervisor at the clinic for the most part was Franz Hamburger, a prominent Austrian pediatrician. Under Hamburger’s guidance, Asperger had the opportunity to observe and work with a diverse range of pediatric cases.\nAsperger’s work on autism was influenced not only by his medical training but also by the clinical experiences and mentorship he received during his tenure at the University Children’s Clinic. His colleagues had a unique way of treating children with special needs and they tried to adopt new ways of teaching and learning for those children. The collaboration between Asperger and Hamburger thus played a crucial role in shaping Asperger’s understanding of child development and psychopathology, contributing to the pioneering observations that would later define his work on autism.\nDuring his tenure at the Children’s Clinic in Vienna, Asperger extensively studied over 200 children. These children displayed a range of symptoms, from prodigious abilities coupled with struggles in school to more severe disabilities that led to institutionalization. Despite the diversity, they all shared common features such as precocious talents, social awkwardness, and an intense focus on laws, rules, and schedules.\nIn 1944, Hans Asperger published a groundbreaking paper titled “Die ‘Autistischen Psychopathen’ im Kindesalter” (“The ‘Autistic Psychopaths’ in Childhood”). This seminal work detailed his observations and conceptualization of a distinctive set of behaviors displayed by certain children, which are now recognized as falling within the autism spectrum.\nAsperger adopted a holistic understanding, viewing autism as a variation in neurodevelopment rather than a disorder. Crucially, Asperger recognized that these symptoms existed on a continuum, affecting both children and adults. He also keenly noted that the symptoms were noticeable in children only when they were 2 years old or older. Additionally, his work acknowledged the lifelong implications of autism but also expressed optimism about individuals leading fulfilling lives with appropriate support.\nWhen Asperger eventually shared his research with the world, he chose to highlight his higher-functioning patients. This decision was influenced by the era he lived in, marked by the Nazis’ pursuit of purifying the land of the “feebleminded,” leading to the euthanization of many institutionalized children. Consequently, Asperger unintentionally conveyed the impression that autism was a rare condition affecting young geniuses, rather than the more common syndrome he had identified. However, despite its significance, the paper did not gain widespread recognition initially, due to the language barrier and the second world war.",

Psychologist Anne Weiss was also a part of the staff at the clinic. Both published papers in 1934-35, which included descriptions of children who had same characteristics as autism. They were working closely with Asperger. Both were jews, and they escaped the Nazi regime in 1935-37. Asperger was named the head of the clinic in 1935.\nFrankl and Weiss, who later married each other went to work with Leo Kanner in 1938. Kanner’s paper titled “Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact” was published in August 1941. Asperger’s paper, which Lorna Wing translated in 1981, was first submitted as a postdoctoral thesis in 1942 and was published in 1944.\nIt is difficult to imagine Kanner was unaware of Asperger’s work, while definitive evidence is not available. One can only wonder what would have happened if they acknowledged each other’s work and collaborated.",

Adding on, Wing also introduced the concept of the “triad of impairments” to describe the core features of autism. This triad includes difficulties in social interaction, communication, and imagination (often manifested as repetitive and stereotyped behaviors). The triad of impairments became a foundational framework for understanding and diagnosing autism spectrum disorders. Along with Judith Gould, she also developed the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI), a structured interview for parents or caregivers of individuals with autism. The ADI became an essential tool for clinicians and researchers in diagnosing autism and gathering information about a person’s behavior and development.\nWing, apart from actively being involved in advocating for individuals with autism and their families, contributed to better recognition and understanding of autism in girls and women by highlighting the underrepresentation of females on the autism spectrum. Her work drew attention to the fact that autism might present differently in females compared to males.\nHer work has had a lasting impact on autism research, diagnosis, and support systems.",

She was among the first adults to publicly disclose she was autistic, in her 1986 book ‘Emergence: labelled autistic.’ Born at a time when children like her were routinely institutionalized, Temple was supported by her mother and developed into the autistic savant as she is recognized today. Her book was based on experiences of an autistic, rooted in her personal experiences, observations, and advocacy. Grandin has provided invaluable insights into the lived experience of autism. Her book “Thinking in Pictures,” offers a first-person account of the sensory experiences, challenges, and strengths associated with autism.\nGrandin’s unique cognitive style, characterized by visual thinking, has been a focal point of her contributions. She coined the term “thinking in pictures” to describe her thought processes, emphasizing the importance of visual cognition in understanding the world. This perspective has influenced how educators and researchers approach autism, and Grandin’s insights have extended to recommendations for creating sensory-friendly environments that support individuals with autism. Her suggestions for adapting educational settings and incorporating sensory considerations have played a role in shaping the design of spaces to meet the needs of individuals on the autism spectrum.\nBeyond her literary contributions, Temple Grandin’s professional endeavors in animal science and her innovative designs for livestock handling facilities reflect her understanding of sensory sensitivities, a common trait in individuals with autism. Her work in enhancing animal welfare demonstrates her ability to apply a unique perspective to real-world challenges. In addition to her autobiographical writings, Grandin has authored numerous books and articles on autism, animal behavior, and related subjects, contributing to the widespread knowledge about autism in both academic and popular contexts.\nStories of Grandin and other adult autistics like her, and the 1988 movie Rainman, also gave rise to the idea that autistics are unusually good at arts or math – a condition called savant syndrome.",

    "text": "2.12 Emergence of neurodiversity paradigm-1990s\nNeurodiversity describes the idea that people experience and interact with the world around them in many different ways; there is no one “right” way of thinking, learning, and behaving, and differences are not viewed as deficits.\nLorna Wing and Temple Grandin changed how people think about autism. They showed that autism is different for each person. Earlier, people thought of autism as the same for everyone. Wing created the idea of the “autism spectrum,” and Grandin talked about the strengths of people with autism. This changed how society saw disabilities. People started thinking about how society makes it hard for people with disabilities. This change made room for a more positive and inclusive view of neurological differences.\nA movement for disability rights also started in the 1960s in the US. This movement said that people with disabilities have rights, and society should include them. The movement challenged old ideas that said having a disability is a problem. People with autism also spoke up for themselves. They said that autism is not just a problem but also a part of who they are. They wanted to show that they have strengths and unique ways of thinking.\nJudy Singer, a key figure in the development of the concept of neurodiversity, learned about the idea of autism as a spectrum from the Autism Association of Australia. This understanding, influenced by British psychologist Lorna Wing’s work, recognized autism as a diverse condition that extends into the broader human experience. Singer’s daughter’s diagnosis with Asperger’s syndrome led her to recognize similar traits in herself, such as difficulty making eye contact and being disorganized.\nSinger, who worked in the IT industry, later pursued studies in sociology and disability at the University of Technology in Sydney. With the advent of the internet, she engaged in online communities, including one called ILMV, where she collaborated with Harvey Blume. Through their discussions, Singer coined the term “neurodiversity,” in the mid 1990-s, emphasizing the value of diverse neurological conditions inspired by biodiversity in nature, which is about valuing different species.\nSinger undertook a thesis titled “Odd People In,” exploring the emergence of a new social movement based on neurological diversity. The thesis focused on online communities and the need for autistic people’s voices to be heard and respected. Singer’s work contributed to the growing neurodiversity movement, advocating for the rights and inclusion of neurodivergent individuals. Neurodiversity is the idea that we should value and include people with different ways of thinking, like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and more. It says that being different is not a bad thing; it adds to the richness of human experience.\nNeurodiversity has become an important idea. It changed how we talk about and see neurological differences. The neurodiversity movement works for the rights and inclusion of people with different ways of thinking in all parts of life.",

While the study was later found to be fraudulent and was retracted, the questions about vaccine safety and impact on autism refuse to leave the public perception.\nAnother detour in the journey of understanding autism was driven by Andrew Wakefield, a British gastroenterologist. Wakefield had been involved in researching gastrointestinal symptoms in children with developmental disorders, particularly those with autism. He had observed certain gastrointestinal issues in some of these children. Wakefield became increasingly concerned about the MMR vaccine, which is administered to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella. He questioned the safety of the vaccine and its potential association with developmental disorders, particularly autism.\nIn 1998, Wakefield and his colleagues published a study in the medical journal The Lancet, claiming to have found a link between the MMR vaccine, bowel disease, and autism in a small group of children. The study, based on a case series of 12 patients, suggested a temporal association between MMR vaccination, gastrointestinal symptoms, and the onset of developmental regression.\nThe study faced immediate criticism for its small and selective sample, lack of a control group, and methodological flaws. Moreover, ethical concerns were raised about undisclosed financial conflicts of interest. Wakefield had financial interests in pursuing research that could potentially link the MMR vaccine to developmental disorders. He was involved in a business venture to develop diagnostic tests for inflammatory bowel disease, and a vaccine scare could potentially benefit his business interests.\nThe study was eventually retracted by The Lancet in 2010 due to ethical concerns and the discovery of undisclosed financial conflicts of interest. Wakefield lost his medical license in the same year, facing disciplinary action for ethical violations.\nThe Wakefield study had a profound impact on public perception and contributed to vaccine hesitancy. However, it has been widely discredited by subsequent research, and Wakefield’s actions have been condemned by the scientific community for their ethical and methodological shortcomings.",

Her detailed description of autistic features in the six boys she observed was published in 1925, nearly two decades before the more widely known work of Asperger and Kanner. Sukhareva recognized the unique cognitive profiles of the children she studied, emphasizing differences in information processing and engagement with the world. Her focus on early childhood and the importance of early identification and intervention aligns with later perspectives on autism.\nSukhareva held a positive view regarding children’s ability to adapt successfully under favorable conditions. She emphasized the significance of the social environment, proper upbringing, and education in stimulating compensatory opportunities for children.\nSukhareva, as a child psychiatrist, observed and highlighted how crucial these factors were in aiding children’s adaptation within their families and at school. This perspective aligned with her evolutionary-biological concept of mental illness. In her 1926 paper, Sukhareva balanced her descriptions by also noting unconventional behavior and challenges faced by the children she observed.\nSukhareva also documented motor coordination issues in some children, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of autism that recognizes the diverse challenges individuals may face. Overall, Sukhareva’s pioneering work laid a foundation for the evolving understanding of autism.\nSula Wolff, a psychiatrist based in Edinburgh, praised Sukhareva’s 1926 publication, stating that Sukhareva summarized the children’s characteristics “admirably” and described her work as “marvellous.” According to Manouilenko and Bejerot, Sukhareva’s descriptions were considered “structured, elegant, detailed,” and “vivid.” They also noted that Sukhareva’s ideas on ways to help autistic children were remarkably “modern.”\nManouilenko and Bejerot suggest that Sukhareva’s gender, her Jewish identity, Russian nationality, and her publications in Russian and German were not an effective combination for gaining worldwide attention in the 1920s.

The most effective way to support autistic people is through understanding, acceptance, and providing individualized supports and accommodations. Early identification can help families and communities better understand and support autistic individuals.\nHowever, autism is a spectrum condition, so the symptoms may vary in type and severity from child to child. In addition, since each child develops in his/her own way, some early signs of autism look like they are part of the natural development of the child. Also, Indian families often tend to think that speaking a little late, being a little unresponsive, is nothing to worry about. One often hears things like “oh, his father spoke at three, look he is all fine now!” and “boys start speaking late anyway”.\nAll of this makes early identification and action difficult for parents. Other family members and friends tend to keep their peace till the child is older. Most medical professionals may also advise a wait and watch approach.\nWhile autism can look different in different children, the most common areas of difference are communication and interaction with others. Signs of autism can be noticed when the children are around 2-3 years of age or even earlier. Parents and caregivers may watch for these signs.\nThroughout this document, we use identity-first language (such as “autistic person” or “autistic child”), in keeping with the preferences of many in the autistic community. However, we recognize and respect that some individuals may prefer person-first language. We also strive to be neurodiversity affirming in our approach.\nWhen you notice any of the following signs in the children around you, it is useful to consult a developmental psychologist or a developmental pediatrician at the earliest. It is possible that these signs do not mean autism, but if they do, then you would have recognized these differences a little earlier and started providing support, thereby helping the child access resources and understanding sooner.",

    "text": "3.2 How common is autism?\nWhen parents are told that their child has or is at risk of autism, their first reaction is shock and then disbelief. They often think “how can this happen to us?” and then go on to “why is this happening to us?” Most people spend about six months to one year trying to make sense of it. They try to rationalize the symptoms; they hope the diagnosis is not correct and that the child will achieve the milestones in another year and things will then be alright.\nPeople seem to believe autism is a rare condition and most people haven’t heard of it before. However, the actual prevalence numbers tell a different story. The highest prevalence numbers come from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in the US. According to their 2020 estimates, 1 in 36 children aged 8 were on the autism spectrum - that is about 3 children per hundred. In the same year, CDC estimated the prevalence of autism in adults at about 2.21% - that is about 2 persons per hundred. The World Health Organization has a lower estimate of about 1 in 100 worldwide, based on a review of about 71 studies across the world from 2012-21.\nThe prevalence numbers for India are not reliably available but the scientific community agrees that the biochemical pathways involved in core autism are unlikely to be different in different populations. This means that the prevalence of autism in India is likely to be closer to the worldwide estimates of about 1 to 3 people per hundred. This means about 1.3 - 1.5 crores of people on the autism spectrum, which is very significant.\nWhat do these prevalence numbers mean? It means we need more awareness about autism because it is not as rare as people believe. We need more awareness in new parents and to-be parents so we are all better prepared. It means we need more facilities, resources and a coordinated action plan for autism in place of the current status where the responsibility is with individual parents.\nThere is another thing that comes to mind - World Health Organization estimates about 1 in 6 people across the world experience a ‘significant disability’ - that is about 16% of the population, numbering about 1.3 billion people. CDC also reports that about 1 in 6 (16%) children aged 3-17 years were diagnosed with a developmental disability in the study period of 2009-17. However, those of us who do not have any disability continue to believe that disabilities are rare, we ignore how common they are and continue to build a world that excludes those with disabilities. That way, people living with disabilities are one of the largest voiceless minorities in the world.\nIn such a world, it is no wonder that people go on without awareness of the incidence of disabilities, they are not educated about the possibility of a disability in their children, and are shocked and surprised when something like autism shows up at their doorstep.\nThese prevalence numbers should make us all aware of the size of the issue, jolt us out of the ignorance and get us started on the path of building more awareness, being more empathetic and inclusive in our daily lives. Listening to autistic people and including their perspectives in conversations about autism is vital for creating supportive and respectful environments.",

    "text": "3.3 What causes autism?\nMost families first respond emotionally when they are told that their child is on the autism spectrum. Some go through denial; others are sad or furious. Soon, emotions give way to questions and one of these questions is - “What caused my child’s autism?” Parents often ask themselves what they could have done differently. Another thought is that if we know what causes autism, maybe we can “cure” it. Some parents also ask this question as they plan to have another child and wonder about the risk of the other child also having autism.\nThe truth is, we do not really know the specific causes of autism. Therefore, it follows that there is no way any parent could have done anything different so their child would not have had autism. Also, since autism is a natural variation in neurodevelopment, currently there is no way to “cure” it. However, the information we have from current studies indicates that if one child in a family is autistic, there is a higher chance of having another autisitc child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we know about causes of autism is that there are a variety of factors - “a spectrum of causes” - behind the occurrence of autism, including genetic and environmental factors.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Genetic Factors\nGenetics plays a large role in the incidence of autism, as evidenced by a 2019 study of more than 2 million people across five countries, which estimated ASD’s heritability to be approximately 80%.\nThe role of genetics is also indicated by the concordance rate (both of two siblings having autism). In siblings, who share 50% of their genes, the occurrence of autism in both the siblings (the concordance rate) is 20%. Similarly, in fraternal twins, who share 50% of genes and grow in the same womb, the concordance rate is 31%. However, genetics are not the only causal factor - this is evidenced by the concordance rate of 77% even in identical twins, who share 100% of their genes, and grow in the same womb.\nHere is a TED talk by Wendy Chung where she talks about genetic factors in autism.\n\nGenetics play a large role does not mean autism runs in the family. Certain individuals have it brand new because of mutations in the sperm or egg at the time of conception which are not passed down. Also, while we know genetics play a large role, the current studies do not provide information on what genes are involved, or even if it is a combination of genes. Furthermore, A study by Simons Foundation found that the genetic changes/ alterations were different for different individuals even among a population of 2600 that had brand new autism - this means there is not 1 gene, but about 300-400 genes (that are not random, but fit together in a pathway/ network) causing autism - possibly why there is such a wide spectrum of autism.\n\n\n3.3.2 Environmental Factors\nA variety of environmental factors have been examined for their contribution to autism. While there are studies that have found correlation between some environmental factors and the incidence of autism, it is important to note that the research is in early stages. The evidence for some of these factors is strong and for some, it is confusing or weak. While we know some of these factors play a role, we do not know how exactly how that role works. In addition, some factors like air pollution are so generic and so widespread that there is little anyone can do about them. So, while we know in general that there are a variety of environmental factors, we do not have a single, actionable, point that can make a significant difference.\nSome of the environmental factors that have a strong to moderate current evidence are:\n\nthe use of certain medications during pregnancy - Valproic acid (given for epilepsy), Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (Used to treat depression)\nextremely preterm birth and low birth weight\nOlder parental age at the time of conception\nBacterial and viral infections in the mother while pregnant\nMaternal autoimmunity\n\nAs of now, we do not exactly know what causes autism. There is much research being conducted on both genetic and environmental causes and the early results are promising. However, if a family has a child on the spectrum now, it might be more important to ask what can help the child rather than what causes autism, since the second question is unlikely to be answered in the near future in a definite way that can change the current ways of supporting autism.",

    "section": "3.4 Do vaccines cause autism?",
    "text": "3.4 Do vaccines cause autism?\nIf you are remotely connected to autism, it is highly likely you have come across this question before. The answer is, no, vaccines do not cause autism. This theory was proposed in 1998, has been thoroughly investigated and conclusively proven to be false by 2010. What contributes to its widespread popularity and longevity?\n\n3.4.1 Origin of the vaccine connection\nIn 1998, a physician by the name Andrew Wakefield made this claim in a paper published in the medical journal Lancet. During that time, the two most popular candidates for the cause of autism were refrigerator parenting and genetics/neurobiology. Wakefield looked at 12 children who were developing normally until the administration of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine and started exhibiting autistic symptoms shortly after. He believed that the vaccine affected the large intestine and assumed that neurotoxic proteins released through the intestine reached the bloodstream and brain, causing autism. His belief was strengthened when all the children he performed colonoscopies on exhibited the lesions.\nThe theory made sense as autism symptoms in children started to appear around the same time as the vaccine administration i.e. 12 to15 months of age. “It was after the vaccine that my child stopped talking/ started behaving this way” is a common refrain one hears even today. The theory also gained popularity with parents as it took away the burden of blame from them. Autism cases were increasing rapidly, people were looking for a cause, and this plausible theory gained credence.\n\n\n3.4.2 Debunking the theory\nThe vaccine link looked obvious and was convenient but other researchers were unable to replicate the findings. Also, considering the diversity of how autism presents itself, a common biological cause looked unlikely to the scientists. In 2005, an investigative reporter alerted the editors at Lancet that Wakefield’s study had been flawed by severe research misconduct, conflict of interests, and falsehood.\nAfter investigating the matter, Lancet retracted the article, and the British Medical Association took disciplinary actions against Wakefield. Since then, any direct connection between autism and the MMR vaccine has been discredited by dozens of studies investigating the roots of autism and the biological effects of MMR and the mumps virus. Also, even as more parents were opting out of MMR vaccination, the rates of autism had been rising.\nSoon after, there was a suspicion about another autism-vaccine link. It was suspected that thimerosal, added to vaccines as a preservative, could cause autism. Thimerosal contains mercury, a poison, but there was no evidence that the small amount was harmful. To see if thimerosal was linked to autism, researchers studied children who received vaccines that contained it. They compared them to kids who received vaccines that did not contain thimerosal and did not find significant differences in the rates of autism. Even then, thimerosal was taken out of most vaccines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2003, there have been nine studies funded or conducted by CDC (Center for Disease Control) that have found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD (autism spectrum disorder). These studies also found no link between the MMR vaccine and ASD in children.\n\n\n\nResearchers have also looked to see if all the vaccines required before age 2 together somehow triggered autism. Children receive 25 shots in the first 15 months of life. Some people feared that getting all those shots so early in life could lead to the development of autism but there is no evidence that this is true. The CDC compared groups of children who received vaccines on the recommended schedule and those whose vaccines were delayed or did not get them at all. There was no difference in the autism rate between these groups.\nThus, through these several scientific studies, it has been concluded that there is no evident link between vaccines and autism.",

    "section": "3.6 What does not cause autism?",
    "text": "3.6 What does not cause autism?\nThere are a lot of misconceptions around autism. Very often parents are blamed, or parents go ahead and blame themselves for the child’s autism. They may think that their parenting is responsible for the child’s autism or in the Indian context, they are likely to blame it on themselves and their bad ‘karma.’ This blame and guilt often push the parents into denial about the child’s autism or into depression believing there is something wrong with themselves. All of this is unnecessary and is only likely to waste precious time that can be better spent on working with children.\nSimilarly, some parents believe that the child’s autism is not really autism, but a set of mild symptoms caused either by too much screen time, or due to lack of social interaction in nuclear families, or because the child has spent time around other children who have autism. Under this belief and the fear of the burden of autism, parents again waste precious time trying to take temporary measures like sending the child to a school to increase social interaction, leaving the children with grandparents, sending them to preschool etc.\nAs we understand, autism research is still young, and we do not have a complete understanding of what exactly causes autism. As of now, what is clear is that a combination of several factors (genetics, parental age at the time of conception, other environmental factors- link to “what causes autism”) may cause autism and we have some clarity on what does not cause autism. The following are some factors that were identified as “causes of autism” earlier but have been ruled out through thorough research.\n\n3.6.1 Bad parenting\nIt was once believed that “refrigerator mothers” meaning cold, uncaring, and emotionally unavailable mothers caused autism in children. Later, by the early 1970s, this cause was studied further, and the theory of refrigerator mothers was disproved.\n\n\n3.6.2 Vaccines\nOne of the most prevalent myths among causes of autism is that vaccines, especially the Measle, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) and the mercury containing vaccines cause autism. This claim has been investigated thoroughly and no link between vaccines and autism has been found. See Section 3.4 for more.\n\n\n3.6.3 Screen time\nIt has been noticed that some children develop autism-like symptoms due to increased screen exposure before 3 years of age. Some studies suggest that increased screen time is associated with melanopsin-expressing neurons and decreasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter, and thus results in deviant behavior, decreased cognitive, and language development. This has been termed virtual autism.\nWhile the symptoms are similar, and virtual autism may be diagnosed as autism, these are two different conditions. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with genetic links and is thus present lifelong. On the other hand, virtual autism has a definite cause, which is excessive screen exposure at an early age/ Intensive Early Screen Exposure and unlike ASD, can be reversed if intervened at the right time and with the right corrective measures.\nThere is no evidence that the autism spectrum disorder is caused by excessive screen time.\n\n\n3.6.4 Lack of social interaction\nFor children on the spectrum, social interaction is a difficulty. They do not intuitively know how to socialize appropriately and may not always have a pleasant experience socializing. However, this is a symptom of autism and not a cause. Children on the spectrum retain their autism, irrespective of the social exposure they get in childhood.\nSocial exposure may desensitize them to social situations but will not take away the autism from them. Thus, lack of social interaction may deprive the child from learning appropriate social skills but does not necessarily cause their autism.\n\n\n3.6.5 Interaction with people on the spectrum\nSome of us believe that if a child is spending time with a child on the spectrum, they may catch autism. But autism does not work like the flu. As we have discussed before, autism is neurodevelopmental and has genetic links. If a child is getting a diagnosis, it is because the child has always had autism. It may be diagnosed late due to various other factors (denial from parents, symptoms being masked etc.) Your child is not diagnosed with autism because he/she was spending time with another child who has autism.\nIn summary, some popular beliefs, or apprehensions about the cause of autism have been conclusively proved to be wrong and an awareness of these can help parents focus their time and energy on more useful approaches to dealing with their children’s autism.",

    "text": "4.1 Profiles\nThis section explores the perspectives of four sets of parents whose teenage children are on the autism spectrum, all participating in a community learning space. We outline each child’s profile, including their diagnosis age and communication methods, before discussing the parents’ experiences with early signs and diagnosis. We further detail their initial emotional responses, the early intervention choices they made, and where they initially sourced information about autism. Finally, we cover their transition from early intervention, their current approaches to managing family life, their hopes and apprehensions for the future, and the advice they offer to newly diagnosed parents. This article is based on in-person interviews conducted in June/July 2024.\nAll the four sets of parents and children are part of a community learning space, some full time and some part time, where they work together in groups, with other mothers and children on the spectrum. They have help from experts in behavior intervention and teaching learning processes.\nS-Ish S is trained as a doctor and a dancer. Her 12 year old son Ish is interested in food and shows interest in doing academic work. He works at 3rd grade level now. He is verbal, and can ask for what he wants. He has a routine of dancing, exercise and regular physical and cognitive engagement. Ish was diagnosed at 3 and went through systematic early intervention till 9 before entering a community learning space.\nH-M H is a microbiologist and a teacher. Her 13 year old son M is partially verbal and uses AVAZ to communicate. H trained as a therapist for 3 years along with M while he took his early intervention and continues to work as an expert mentor. M was diagnosed when he was 3 years old, went through systematic early intervention, and joined a community learning space. While he is independent with his daily living, he needs someone to be constantly with him to take care of his safety around the kitchen and on the roads. M enjoys nature.\nS-S S is a housewife married to a doctor and are parents of 3 sons. The oldest being 14 years old, the second, S being 11 years old and on the spectrum and the youngest, 4 years old. S was 2 when he was diagnosed. They stayed in the US until the youngest son’s birth and till they could find stable help for S back in India. S is verbal and can communicate his likes and dislikes. He often does so with Disney characters. S knows disney movie lines by heart.\nS-G S is a nurse, lecturer and a teacher. Her son, G is close to 13 years old and is partially verbal. He was diagnosed when he was 1 year 7 months. He went through special education early intervention along with speech and occupational therapy. He started Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Therapy when he was 6 years old, has been using AVAZ since he was 6.5 years old and can now communicate anything that he wants through the app. S has undergone parent training and also trained to be a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) while G was taking ABA therapy. They are now a part of a homeschooling group where the parent and child participate in the teaching learning process under the guidance of experts. G loves listening to music.",

    "section": "4.2 Early signs and diagnosis",
    "text": "4.2 Early signs and diagnosis\nWhat were some early signs or behaviors that made you think your child might be different? What prompted you to seek a diagnosis for your child?\nS-Ish - Ish always used to cry. I thought it was usual for babies to cry and always just tried to stop his crying. He didn’t feel different at all. I left him under the care of my mother and went to continue my masters. My mother felt it was difficult to deal with him. He wouldn’t communicate much but we assumed he could be a late speaker. Despite our medical background, we couldn’t pick up on the signs until we went for a friend’s get together and a pediatrician friend saw him and suggested we go for a diagnosis from a clinical psychologist. The appointment was 2 days away. So, I started reading up about Autism and realized that Ish was ticking off almost everything on the checklist. I could relate with all the symptoms. He was 2 years and 6 months old then. He was diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD, NOS) at that point.\nHM - M had evident milestone delays by 5 months of age. He wasn’t sucking, there was no neck control, no eye contact or any non-verbal communication. We were noticing the signs until he was 1 year old but could not understand what or why. He was 1.5 years old and there was no speech yet. Until then we were doubtful. We were also scared that if we go get it checked, there might be something wrong. We were convincing ourselves saying that he is a boy and so the developmental delays. But co-incidentally he also happened to swallow a plastic toy around that time and while visiting the pediatrician for that, I shared my concerns about his developmental delays. The pediatrician checked and referred to a developmental pediatrician. Through few assessments, they diagnosed him with Autism Spectrum Disorder and auditory intolerance.\nSS - My mother-in- law visited us in the US when S was 2 years old. She, like any grandmother, tried interacting with my kids and noticed that S may have developmental delays. Until 2 years of age, it was like S was hitting off all the milestones. He would interact, respond to his name and even follow instructions. It was from 2 years onwards that he started walking on toes even when his shoes were on, and became a very picky eater, especially after he started daycare. We then took him for diagnosis and they said he was on the borderline of the spectrum. We were not given a real picture at all.\nSG - G was around 1 year old. He was a very happy, relaxed child. Social smile used to be there, but there was no responding to name or signs of imitation while interacting with my in-laws. Slowly, he started to spin anything and everything he could spin (plate, bicycle wheel). If there was nothing, he would sit and spin himself. He was meeting physical milestones with a 2-3 months delay, so we thought he would be a slow learner or maybe have some difficulty with hearing alone. My in-laws felt there was a delay in development and we also felt he was different from other kids we see around. We visited a pediatrician and he said there seems to be some issue and referred us (to NIMHANS) for diagnosis. There, within 5 minutes he was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and we were just told that there is no cure, therapies are the only way to manage and that there are therapy centers where we can go and get more information. I had studied about Autism during my studies but in small detail. I knew it was a childhood disorder, but nothing more. My husband and I were not convinced with the way he was diagnosed and traveled to Mysore to get a detailed assessment done. There he was again assessed in detail, diagnosed and we were briefed about the disorder in good detail.",

    "section": "4.3 Just after diagnosis",
    "text": "4.3 Just after diagnosis\nWhat were your feelings and thoughts before and immediately after the diagnosis? Was there a period of uncertainty?\nS-Ish - I was in shock and denial. I knew vaguely about Autism from what we studied as part of our medical course, but nothing much. It was during the before and after diagnosis period when I gathered the information. I would cry almost everyday after the diagnosis. There was a period of uncertainty for about a month. But my sister and husband were very supportive through the process. My sister would send encouraging videos/ resources. My husband believes that any problem will have a solution and he said we would be able to do something. So let’s figure that out. There was now a shift in my career goals. My initial expectation was that my mother would take care of my son and I can complete my Postgraduate (PG) course. Now I had to take a break from my PG course and I decided to take care of the child full time. He became my first priority. I am very glad that I had and have my family’s support. My father was slightly disappointed that I am unable to focus on my career and hoped that I would get back at it.\nHM - Only M and I had gone for the assessment while my spouse was at his office. When they provided the diagnosis, I was in shock and sent an SMS to my husband. He also took off for the day and came immediately. M was 1 year and 8 months old then. I was scared, I cried and didn’t eat properly for about a week. My husband also took a week’s time to come to terms with this. We started therapy straightaway at the same center, but we were also trying to seek help from a neurologist, visited temples, made offerings and visited astrologers on the side. That was our period of uncertainty. We also blindly followed whatever was referred to at the center. The professionals we encountered did not give extended support, but they did their work and did not give any false hope either. Other parents sailing in the same boat were my source of comfort at that point.\nSS - Soon after he was diagnosed, we came to India thinking he would improve by being around the extended family. We also wanted to check out options available in India. But we couldn’t get any help. Family was not supportive and we couldn’t find the right therapists. It was so frustrating. We were clueless and returned to the US because it felt like there was at least something we could do there. Most people said that he would improve with age and my family members didn’t believe in the idea of therapy. It took me 8 years to accept S’s autism. Meanwhile I would question why this is happening only to me and had a blind hope that S would become normal.\nSG - I would say that I didn’t let the diagnosis affect me too much immediately. I thought this is something I know very little of. I need to know more and see what I can try. We were told that there is no cure. That was painful and uncomfortable for almost a year. I was expecting G to be a normal child or at least just a slow learner and what came to us was unexpected. But I did not go to the denial stage. I was aware and accepting of what has come to us. Questions of what next and the confusion were there. On that front, I wish during our first diagnosis itself, they spent a little more time with us to brief us about the condition. My family gave me all the emotional and moral support I required and I am thankful for that. The suggestions thrown at us from different directions to try homeopathy, ayurveda etc., lead us to a confused state and we didn’t know what to do. However, we did not waste much time. We enrolled him for speech and occupational therapy right away. The special education center also provided us with parent training and also we could take counseling sessions. That was helpful. I stopped comparing G with other kids and feeling bad about it.",

    "section": "4.4 Initial steps and alternatives",
    "text": "4.4 Initial steps and alternatives\nWhat initial steps did you take after diagnosis? What were the alternatives you considered? How did it work out?\nS-Ish - We enrolled him in therapy for early intervention but things happening there scared me. Ish would just go into the center, cry and come back. In the occupational therapy assessments, they said he has mild to moderate autism. The occupational therapist suggested a few centers. Speech therapy was difficult to find. In none of the centers we were allowed inside and we didn’t know much about what was happening inside. I would just see the materials used at the center and repeat them at home with my own knowledge. Those were out of my own will. There were no inputs from any of the centers. In one of the centers, they suggested a hands-on training course, but that’s about it. Through different parents we met at different centers, and the therapists, we kept trying different centers for speech, Occupational Therapy and ABA. Most of the parents suggested alternative medicine treatments as well but we didn’t want to go for it due to lack of empirical evidence.\nHM - We continued therapy in the same center for 2 years. M was going to OT and special education. They would tell things we could try at home, but nothing regarding behavior management. We were still clueless about that. It was especially difficult with M, as he had a lot of behaviors. Eating was an issue with him, he would fall sick often, cry constantly and that would also affect me emotionally. He also went to a Montessori school briefly where he would just go, cry in class, jump on the trampoline and come back. We tried two Montessori schools in the hope that if he is in a group, he would pick up some skills. Nothing like that happened. We considered alternative medicine especially for his immunity. We tried homeopathy when he was 6 years old. We also tried a tapping therapy. By then my husband felt that M was not improving. He did the research and we joined a good therapy center.\nSS - In India, we couldn’t find anything suitable. We decided to go back to the US and once we were back, we tried HyperBaric Oxygen Treatment and the B12 shot. These were suggested by many people and we learnt from our research that it is safe and does not have side effects. We were told that S might have Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). We feel the B12 shot helped S with certain symptoms like hyperactiveness alone. In the US they use sign language with the kids in therapy, by default. There it is more like going with the flow of the child and not pushing them to do anything. We were not satisfied, but we didn’t have many options either. S was also briefly going to daycare where I would drop and the father would pick him. I feel that may have affected our mother son relationship at that point because I would always drop. S also became a picky eater meanwhile. He would eat very selective foods - warm/ food that I cook/ it should be served in a bowl, strictly no milk etc. He went to school along with a shadow teacher while we were in the US, but it wasn’t very effective. We also went through other challenges like having a non-supportive family, and ineffective therapy centers. I did not get any parent training anywhere. Much later, through a friend, we found out about a center in India providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). We relocated and I would say the game changer was when we started writing down the instructions for S. S started following through so quickly. I realized how bothered he was with our verbal inputs. There was also a good set of therapists and structure in place for the kids. The schedule and transparency made me feel comfortable and felt I should have started here earlier.\nSG- We started special education early intervention when he was 2 years old and speech and occupational therapy too. He was picking up skills, but we did give in to the influence of other parents of trying new things for 8 months in between. We tried Ayurveda when he was 5 years old. G was naturally a calm kid while we let him be. Through Ayurveda they again gave calming medicines only. So I didn’t see any significant differences. Another major reason I dropped out of it was following the GFCF Diet. G is a foodie and I felt bad in restraining him from so many foods. It was also difficult for me to follow all the time. I then started believing in my efforts and myself for G.",

    "text": "4.5 Initial sources of information\nWhere did your knowledge of autism and how to work with it come from initially? Was it helpful? When and where did you find the most useful knowledge?\nS-Ish- My knowledge of autism came from the readings I did online. I would watch youtube videos of ABA to work with him at home. What I found particularly helpful was videos made by Chrys Vawnik and Temple Grandin’s Thousand ideas book. My sister would also send articles or videos of autistics doing well in society, to encourage me.\nHM - Initially our knowledge of autism came from whatever the professionals were saying, whatever my husband was reading online and whatever I was hearing from fellow parents at the different therapy centers. After joining this therapy center and as I was training to be a therapist, I gained a lot of insight from the theories. ABA Goals gave me an understanding of what I can expect out of my child or any child I am working with. The Verbal Behavior Approach book by Barbara, was helpful for me.\nSS - The doctor didn’t give us any clear information. We did our own reading and we would hear from our friends or my husband’s colleagues from the US. We also heard from the therapy centers. I would say nothing was helpful. We didn’t gain any clarity. The readings were mostly from the US websites and it included the US way of looking at children, which didn’t really suit our ideas of children. Colleagues and friends believed it would get better with age. The most useful knowledge I would say came from some readings that my husband did, like looking for alternatives. I would say most of my knowledge of autism came from this therapy center. That is where I got a real picture of my son.\nSG - The first knowledge I got was from the center at Mysore where I took G for a detailed assessment. At AISHA, they gave us detailed information. Other sources of my knowledge also included friends who also have autistic kids, other parents I met anywhere in the public. They were helpful. I did not hide my kid. He would come with us everywhere. That opened new conversations and new ideas. That way I also was learning to handle G in different environments and that also let me know what I can expect out of my child. I think I can say that I relied more on the knowledge I gained from real experiences of people than textual or theoretical knowledge. Apart from that, I also gained more understanding when I did my RBT course and training and while I worked with other kids. The RBT theory really helped me understand things from the kid’s perspective.",

    "text": "4.6 Early intervention choices and impact\nWhat early intervention did you settle on and how did it impact you and your child?\nS-Ish - I was always on the lookout as I was not completely satisfied with the therapies I was receiving. He was going for OT, Speech and other therapies where there used to be some schedule and goals. Everywhere it felt like we were paying a lot of money, Ish was going inside, crying and coming back. At that point, I did not see crying behavior as a part of the learning process. We were a little unsettled because nowhere we were allowed inside and there was not much clarity. We also sent Ish to school. He attended LKG and UKG with a shadow teacher. My initial goals were that Ish should speak, should not cry and behave well, and that he should attend a mainstream school. These were the goals I had for him until he was 6 years old. After that, he started to communicate which I was happy about. By then he also acquired certain patterns and I had a shift in my goals. By then his OT was also going alright. The therapist gave home plans and some ABA tips. I was still seeking help with other therapies and asked for suggestions as I did not know how to manage at home. The therapist then referred me to this therapy center for ABA.. Since it was transparent and we were given a clear picture here, we felt more settled. At no point, I gave up working on him. Meeting parents who were confident gave hope that they must be doing something right. So I would seek their help. My family was very supportive through this process. My husband would say decide whatever is working for you and do that, we’ll support you. My mom and sister were always available for me. Financially also we didn’t have challenges. That was a big plus point for us. We also sent Ish to other classes like the Kumaon class where they teach the Japanese method of learning math and english. I stopped OT and started physical training instead when he was 7 years old.\nHM - We started with special education, but since we did not see any improvement, we shifted to ABA. We knew about ABA before, but financially we were not sure if we could support it long term. While shifting we thought we’ll see for 2 years and then we could homeschool. I wish we had started earlier. M underwent food intervention as he was not eating properly. Even to get him to drink water was a struggle. But once we cracked it, it opened up new skills and learnings for M. His sitting tolerance increased and hyperactivity went down. With the schedule in place, his anxiety also went down. We were very happy with the progress he was making.\nSS - We settled on whatever was provided in the US. They were doing ABA, but quite different from what is being offered here. They used sign language for communication predominantly with kids who were not fluent. He was picking vocabulary from Disney movies and would then use that for communication. He started talking again by the time he was 8 years old. Until then his school provided speech therapy and Occupational therapy. I wish we found this therapy center earlier and started off here.\nSG - Special education. It worked for G. He picked up a few skills. Even though it was slow, he was picking up things until I decided to put him in a preschool after 1 year of early intervention, going with the suggestion of his special education therapy center. I feel like he might have regressed there. He dropped even the few skills he had picked up. He was still continuing Occupational Therapy and Speech Therapy, so things were alright at that front. I removed him from the preschool and enrolled him in another special education therapy center itself for another year before going for ABA.",

Why?\nS-Ish - He was 7 years old, getting educated and trained in different things, but we did not know what next for him. School was not working. What next in life, in academics, in leisure skills etc. were new questions that popped up. COVID hit and for 2 years he was taking online therapy. Simultaneously the learning community space opened and some parents I know were already a part of it. Since we were getting full time parent training there, we also decided to join the community learning space.\nHM- We kept trying different things throughout but I realized that I am unable to be consistent at home. Managing household chores and M was becoming overwhelming. The consistency was limited only to the therapy center. COVID hit and that’s when the realization hit as well. We realized that we can’t homeschool him like we planned while joining ABA. There has to be something else. This learning community space opened and we thought that would be the next best option.\nSS -Through the 8 years we were constantly in the lookout for something better as we were not satisfied with what was being offered in the US. That’s when we got to know of this therapy center and we had our initial discussion with the founders of the center.\nSG - He was 6 years old and I felt like he was still not picking any skills. He was still dependent on us for a lot of things. He wasn’t even potty trained. So all of these were concerning and I started looking out for other options when I landed at this therapy center through a friend.",

    "text": "4.8 After early intervention\nWhat were your next steps? What have you been doing over the last few years? How has your journey been?\nS-Ish- It was not until I moved to the community learning space that I realized how prompt dependent Ish had been. Even with things I thought he was independent, I realized he is prompt dependent and not really independent. With being in such a space full time, came more awareness and knowledge. I had revised my goals for him by now. I wanted him to be able to express his feelings, have leisure skills where he is independent and that he should be able to manage himself even if I am not around. He should be able to work and be with other teachers/ therapists/ parents. I realized that each autistic kid is different and each of them are good at something of their own. We should provide the space to enhance those skills and encourage them. My journey has been full of learning that way and I feel like I am on my right path. When I look back, I feel hopeful. I have been able to achieve goals I had for myself and I see that Ish is also going there. An advice that has stuck with me is that we should have set goals for another 5 years and then we can work towards that. This advice has made me rethink the beliefs I had.\nHM- We joined the community learning space and his food intervention continued in full swing. I figured that I am able to be much more consistent here and also bring in new ideas and goals as I interact with others and work with other kids. M also improved a great deal. He started to explore more food items. With that, he also became more open to other things. He started to pick up new skills like cycling, gardening etc. It has been a great learning journey for the both of us. We have new goals as he progresses. I also have the space to work on myself and set things in my own life.\nSS - We booked our tickets to India after knowing about this therapy center. Unfortunately COVID hit and we had to wait for another 3 years before we moved to India. S was taking therapy at the early intervention center in order to be prepared to move into the community learning space. We were just waiting to know that he was ready. My youngest kid was also becoming a picky eater so I sought food intervention alone for him and now he is also here with us at the learning community. It is working well for us that way except that our oldest kid misses on the time he would get to spend with us. But he also sees the point of this now and he is okay. The siblings spend their time together during the weekends. I see a great deal of improvement in S and I am very happy I am here.\nSG - We started ABA and there was no going back, It took 1 year for him to be potty trained by following schedules. The structured program in the center was very helpful. I could see a lot of changes in him within that 1 year. He already had some sitting tolerance and he used to follow instructions. But things improved with ABA and the introduction of AVAZ. The 3 mantras I would say that has worked wonderfully with G are structure, schedule and consistency. I also got the opportunity to be trained as an RBT and it has been a good experience for me. Getting to work with other children was rewarding and at the same time provided hope to work with my child. When you see the fruit for the work you put in, it is highly motivating. After ABA I tried group therapy for G for 1 year in between, but it wasn’t very effective. Then COVID hit and we were working online and I was working with him at home. We are now a part of this homeschooling community where again I get to work with other kids and I am learning new things. G also gets to learn in a group and with new challenges, comes new learnings for the both of us.",

Everyone else adjusted according to our needs. My decision and my clarity was enough for all of them. My mother even moved closer to our house to help me out as I was juggling between different therapy centers. I wanted to get back to my career at some point but those thoughts came slowly as and when we were feeling slightly settled. I got to complete my PG course as well. Now I am able to leave Ish and go away for my work at least for a few hours and then come back. I feel like I have come a long way.\nHM - My family was not very supportive. It was just my husband and I. I started attending to M full time. It was becoming overwhelming to manage household chores and M at home. I lacked the motivation to follow through M’s interventions even though I knew what had to be done. Now I have come a long way and learnt so many things. I plan and organize my work better in order to balance my personal work and M’s works. I also take or ask for help actively. I have learnt to do that and I am grateful.\nSS - I dedicated myself to my family. I wish I had said no to other commitments now. I couldn’t fully focus on S because of the other commitments. Right now, I am happy we are here. My youngest kid is also getting the right education and S is getting to be with him as well. So I am happy, going with the flow. Kids are my 1st priority for now and right now it is S. I have wasted a lot of time already and do not want to waste anymore.\nSG - I made up my mind that now I will have to spend more time with my kid. I had to give up on my career as a lecturer, but I don’t regret it. I feel I can get back to it anytime, right now G is my focus. And I don’t feel whatever I’m doing currently is very different from what I wanted to do. I wanted to go to the hospital and work at some point, I would be serving the older population there, here I am serving the child population. My in-laws and husband were very supportive. I had difficulty managing time for the first 1 year then I learnt to prioritize. My family has supported me and my decisions consistently. They also learn the interventions and that helps in being consistent with G. They took time to accept AVAZ, but it wasn’t very difficult to convince them when I stayed put.",

Now Ish is able to manage himself while I attend meetings and I am able to focus on my career as well while I am able to trust and leave him in the learning community. His learning is also not hindered. Goals are set and we are moving towards his goals as well while meeting our personal goals. I hope he will be in a position to manage our hospital reception at some point. Not much apprehension at this point in time. I used to be worried about him hitting or getting aggressive when he gets upset or angry. Now that we have been able to manage that, it all feels like it can be managed.\nHM - M touches himself right now. That scares me, but at the same I am hopeful that we will figure out how to manage that as he is in a safe space now to learn that. I am slightly apprehensive of what he is going to be in the future, but at the same time in the mindset of whatever can be done in the present with him, let’s do it and see where it is leading.\nSS - As he is approaching adolescence, some fears and questions I have are about him managing his private space and understanding personal boundaries. He is still learning to close doors while he dresses up or to respect a closed door when others are dressing up. I hope he builds enough motor skills to protect himself and the question of what and who after me is lingering in my mind. I do not want S to be dependent on his siblings nor do I want the siblings to feel obliged. Also the thought of “What if he gets physical when he is angry?” scares me now.\nSG - I see people are more aware now and they provide support wherever and whenever they can. That makes me feel hopeful, but I would like for G to be independent with his life skills at least. My apprehensions are also on the same lines. Not all people will be the same. So that fear of how society would treat him, would they take advantage of his challenges are some questions I have in mind. Right now he is not completely independent, but I expect him to get to a stage where he can take care of himself. I also see new interests popping up as we expose him. So I am now open to exploring his interests with him and if he is able to pick on them, we as parents are ready to completely support him.",

    "text": "4.11 Advice for new parents\nWhat advice would you give parents of newly diagnosed children?\nS-Ish - I feel parents have to go through their own journey in order to gain an understanding of their kid’s autism and how the family has to work around it. But be involved with your kid. Put in the hard work, time and effort. If you have the chance to work with other autistic kids, it would enhance your understanding of autism. So take up such opportunities. Seek community support. It has been very helpful for us. I would also advise them to reach out to parents who are encouraging especially in the beginning stages as they give hope. Start as early as possible. Therapy is the best thing to do, but do some research as well as to what would work for the child and the family. According to me, the most important thing of all is to take support from wherever and whenever possible.\nHM - Start with ABA. There is no cure to Autism, but it is manageable. So have hope in that and continue to work. Don’t waste time and money on offerings/ astrology/ priests etc., while you are still figuring out Autism.\nSS - Be strong and give all your attention to your kids while they are growing up. Don’t wait for a miracle to happen, it is not going to happen. Instead, work with your kid.\nSG - I know and understand that it will be very difficult to accept in the first because of the various expectations we formed as we were giving birth to the child, but eventually accept it with confidence. End of the day, this is still our kid. Be consistent with your effort and go ahead. Don’t think like there is no life forward or nothing can be done. There will be positive sides, so try and look at them. With our kids, even little things make a lot of difference. Enjoy them! Also, do not just aim to put them in a normal school. Think through your decisions and think from the child’s perspective as well. Do what would be best for the child. Our children’s needs are different.",

    "text": "5.1 Profiles\nThe following are the perspectives gathered from parents of four children between the ages 5 to 8 years. All the children are in early intervention through ABA and/or Occupation Therapy (OT) and speech therapy. The children are not in formal school and the mothers typically spend their entire time taking care of the children. These perspectives were gathered through in-person interviews in August 2024.\nS-Am\nS is a housewife who loves spending time with children and cooking for them. She says she would think of dishes her children would like and try out new items all the time. As a mother of 2 children, her day usually goes by in taking care of and spending time with the children. Am is the 2nd child, currently 6 years old, loves to play and arrange things in a linear fashion. Am enjoys fruits, and food, especially spicy chicken. Am is taking ABA sessions for 2 hours a day.\nP-M\nP loves stitching and was doing it for a living until she got married. 2 children later, she has dedicated her time to taking care of them. M, the older son is 7 years old and was diagnosed when he was 3 years old. He would want a new toy everyday and the interest with a toy wouldn’t last for more than 10-15 minutes. He has always loved going to the park, and recently he has also started asking for going to the shop, understanding that we buy things from a shop. Now, he also senses that when the mother says she is going out, it means she won’t be there for sometime, so he asks to go along. M challenges everyone working with him with his head banging behavior. M takes ABA sessions along with OT currently.\nY-An\nY has a masters degree in Electronics and Communication and worked as a lecturer and HR consultant until she had a child. Y enjoys watching devotional material on her mobile when she is free. She is currently a housewife who is focusing on her children. Y and her 2 children relocated from Barcelona recently to seek ABA therapy for her 5 year old son, An. An is pre-verbal as of now and gets excited when he sees spinning objects. He also seems to enjoy traveling in any vehicle, and playing with water. An has just started ABA sessions and Y is looking forward to seeing how this pans out for An.\nJ-S\nJ completed her MA in history and B.ed. She is a government school teacher and has been on leave for the last 3 years to take care of children. Her 1st born, S who is 8 years old now, was diagnosed when he was around 3 years old. S says he loves reading books related to history and enjoys fine arts but there has not been any time for them recently. S is attending ABA sessions now for 1.5 years and J also actively participates in his sessions. S has started to communicate his feelings, started to know appropriate actions in appropriate places (for example, he knows park is for playing and temple is for praying.) S has also started to choose his dress and dress himself up. Recently he has also started to flush the toilet and clean his hands after that, all by himself. J was gleaming as she expressed all of this. They are also able to take him to functions and manage him. That way, there has been a lot of social learning in the last 1.5 years.",

What prompted you to seek a diagnosis for your child?\nS-Am\nAm used to say Dada and Mumma. Around 2 years of age, he stopped saying those words. He would also play by himself mostly. His grandfather visited that time and we all felt something was off. When he was 2 years and 5 months, we took him to the doctor as he was now also becoming more hyper. During the lockdown time, we also saw that he started lining up toys. It started with toys and it went on to anything and everything he could put his hand on. The doctor did some assessments and symptom checks and told us he has Autism.\nP-M\nM didn’t talk when he was 2 years old. When he was about 2.5 years old, there was an incident when he was at his grandparents place where he woke them up around 2-3am and started dancing on the bed. This happened once or twice. He got a fever when he was around 3 years old and while we took him to the doctor then, we expressed this concern and they suggested we take him for an assessment. We were told he has Autism and that there is no cure, but can be made manageable with therapy. He was 3 years old when he got diagnosed.\nY-An\n\nNo response to name call\nHe liked to watch things that were spinning\nHe would line up objects\nThere was also no eye contact\n\nWe took him to the physician in Barcelona when he was 2 years old and they suspected Global Developmental Disorder (GDD) and at 3.5 years old he was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum disorder Level II as per their classification system.\nJ-S\nTill S was 1 year old, everything seemed very normal. We started noticing evident signs only after he was 2 years old. He was not pointing, no eye contact and he also didn’t talk. When we noticed that he was not talking, we took him to the doctor. S was 2.5 years old by then. They saw him and said that it looks like symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder. We did not take that seriously and started school when S was 3 years old. After teachers there pointed out concerns, we again visited a psychologist for the 3rd time and got a detailed report on the diagnosis.",

Was there a period of uncertainty?\nS-Am\nI didn’t understand what was going on. I had been believing that everything was normal. How could something be wrong now? I cried a lot. We did not understand and we were not satisfied either. So we wanted to get a 2nd opinion and went to NIMHANS. There they said symptoms are there but also told us not to worry and fear so much as he will be fine slowly. We were still confused.\nP-M\nI was so confused because we did not know the head or tail of Autism and no one gave us a clear picture. He was diagnosed at NIMHANS and they suggested we take their therapy that happens once in every 3 months, but no more information was given. Both my husband and I were very upset. I didn’t eat for about a week and kept crying. Then I had to tell myself that I need to be strong for my son and I have to change. Yet, for about a year things were uncertain as M was taking therapy only at NIMHANS once every 3 months and we did not know how to manage him nor did we see any improvements. I felt helpless as managing 2 children was difficult. My mother would come for 1 week or 2 and help out, but I had to run the show.\nY-An\nAfter the possible GDD diagnosis when we went for review at 3.5 years, I kept praying that nothing should be wrong. After hearing the word, I cried in front of the doctor. There was fear of the future and it took me 2-3 months to accept the fact and now I am hopeful that there will be something that can be done to manage this. An was attending school back then and they were very supportive and caring. A special educator would come and teach him once or twice a week and ensure there is some learning happening. At 2 years when they said he might have GDD itself I started looking up and reading and enquiring about the various possibilities. So after the Autism diagnosis there was no period of uncertainty as such.\nJ-S\nThe term sounded like Greek and latin. We have never heard of this before. We were very worried. S was our first child. He was born 4 years after our marriage and through treatment. He was very precious to us. That 1 year after that was very difficult. S was getting more hyper and aggressive. I was still processing this. I used to get very irritated and show my frustration to my husband. My husband was in a better place due to the way he generally sees things and would say “This is not a problem we created for ourselves. This is God-given and there will also be a solution to this.” I also got pregnant with my 2nd child that year, so I had to take care of myself. Then I became calmer with the support of my family.",

We hear different opinions from different people and it is more confusing. We don’t know what is right and what is wrong yet. Some ask us to stop everything, some ask us to take ABA, Speech and OT.

Even the current ABA center, SCA, I found out myself through google. At a rehab center M went to initially, they gave us some understanding, but Google has been helpful for me.\nY-An\nMy knowledge came from doctors, specialists and fellow parents.

Hearing their experiences of how they approached or what they did has helped me in shifting perspectives and taking decisions.\nJ-S\nIt mostly came from professionals, where we went to seek diagnosis/ therapy.

We consulted with the doctor again and he suggested we go for one to one sessions. When AM was 3.5 years old he started one to one sessions and would attend group sessions as well. They also recommended medication for him to sleep as he was not sleeping at all. We gave him the medication, but since I saw that he was not sleeping, I stopped it myself. The group and one to one sessions went on for a year but we were not satisfied as we were still confused. There was no clarity about why we are doing what we are doing. There was no transparency at the center also. When he was 4.5 years old we started ABA sessions. That is again from parents’ suggestions. In the last 1.5 years I have an idea and I am able to see what is being done to Am. We see that it is working too.\nAlternatives, we gave him homeopathy medicines for his sleep when he was 2.5 years old as suggested by a doctor. We stopped when he started to sleep at night. We didn’t want him to become dependent on medicines as Am loves medicines because of its sweet taste. In our house, we lock medicines in the locker like we lock up gold because of this.\nP-M\nWe took the therapy they suggested at NIMHANS once every 3 months for half an hour each session. He was also given medicines for his hyperactiveness. We were not satisfied and on the lookout for help about knowing what is to be done. During one such instance when my husband who is working as a driver expressed our concern to one of the doctors he was driving for, they suggested a rehab center. There they started him on OT, ST and infant sessions. After 2-3 months speech therapy sessions stopped, and also he was doing well. So they suggested we take him to school now. At school they found him to be too hyper and having low sitting tolerance. Now we were looking for options that offered school and therapy and I understood we needed ABA for working on his sitting tolerance. When I was searching on these bases, the ABA Center SCA popped up. So we have started ABA here now.\nY-An\nIn the Spanish system, they don’t want to label or do any therapy until the child is above 3 years. So only after the diagnosis at 3.5 years, we started speech and OT where An would have 1 session of each every week. He attended this for about a year and when we came to India for vacation, we met a developmental pediatrician and from her suggestion to try ABA for a year or so, my children and I have moved to India now. Alternatives I didn’t consider as much as there are only so many options available back in Spain. They have sensory integration therapy, then there is speech and occupational therapy. We considered homeopathy after one of our relatives who is a homeopathic doctor suggested, but we are yet to discuss and take that forward.\nJ-S\nSince we didn’t take it seriously the first time, we right away started S with school. After the 2nd consultation is when we started him on therapies. They suggested we take Speech, OT and Behavior therapy. We found a center closer to our house for behavior therapy and started therapy there. We found other places for Speech and OT too. We tried Homeopathy because my husband’s friend suggested for S’s aggressiveness. We stopped in a few months time as there were no changes. We also tried Ayurveda Panchakarma treatment for 8 months. We found that also useless. It was time consuming and also costly. We tried allopathy medicines for his behaviors. It showed results. That’s when we stopped Ayurveda. S was also attending school with a shadow teacher and a caretaker. After a teacher suggested this center for ABA, we have stayed here as we are seeing a lot of progress in S now.\nEditor’s note: While some of the parents mention alternatives, we do not endorse any of them. Many of the alternatives that parents try are not evidence based. Some can be outright dangerous. Please see Chapter 9 for a detailed discussion of alternative approaches and why one should be cautious about them.",

So far to figure things out and see what is working and not working itself took us some time. There has been so much confusion for us with regard to what to do. He is one person but there are so many different opinions. We are spending money and time and we expect it to be worth it. We have shelled out a lot of money so far and it has impacted our family that way.\nP-M\nOccupational therapy, Speech therapy and Applied Behavioral Analysis is what we settled on. I think they have all helped us in knowing how to manage him. We are in a better place from where we started.\nY-An\nWe settled on OT, Speech initially as he was not talking. Speech therapy was good there maybe but I don’t think it worked for An. We are taking ABA after the doctor’s suggestion in India now. That has definitely left an impact on the family. My husband is managing alone and the 3 of us are here at my parents’ place. It’s a lot of stress for the both of us as parents, but we have hope. Other than that I think as a family now we have become more understanding of each other and we see more positivity. My husband has become more patient now, I feel. An is more settled now because of the interventions we have done so far. An’s sister also shares a good bond with him and takes care of him whenever necessary. She was confused initially as to why An is behaving a certain way. But once we explained, she understood him. For her also, shifting to India was a major shift as the schooling systems are very different and she is getting accustomed.\nJ-S\nAfter a point we felt like we were taking too many treatments and they were hard on our pockets too. So we stuck with Behavior therapy. S was 7 years old by then. After coming to the ABA center, we have been here for the past 1.5 years now. This is going well. S has become manageable and that is a huge blessing to our family. I feel hopeful as it looks like I am on the right path.",

What has helped me settle here is that I see progress and when I look back I see that the therapists work with dedication and the session timings are longer here. In most centers each session is only for 45 minutes and it goes in settling down itself. There is not much learning happening. How much my child is learning is also a factor I have looked into.",

So a huge chunk of my responsibilities otherwise, household chores, is taken care of. My daughter has also started to manage herself. When An was born, she was already 8 years old, so managing 2 children has not been a problem for me. My husband is managing himself back in Spain. The good thing here is that this decision was not forced upon anyone. It is mutual and a collective decision. We thought we should not regret not trying this option. So we all are up for trying this for 1 year and seeing where it takes us.\nJ-S\nMy family supports me immensely through this process. I cannot imagine doing any of this without their support.

In this process, parents, family members, or caregivers closely follow a child’s development in areas such as play, learning, speech, behavior, and physical movement. This vigilance allows them to gauge whether the child is reaching the typical developmental milestones and promptly detect any concerns that may arise. It’s advisable to maintain regular communication with the child’s primary physician regarding their developmental progress. Additionally, doctors routinely evaluate a child’s development during their regular check-up visits.\nWhen there are concerns about the development of the child, parents should consult their primary care physician and they may be referred for further screening.",

As a result, it may not be a straightforward procedure, but early diagnosis is crucial for both the child and their family to enhance their quality of life and meaningfully navigate the condition.\n\n6.3.1 Developmental Screening\nIf any delays or concerns are observed, the next step is to undergo developmental screening, a more formal evaluation of a child’s developmental progress. This screening process is conducted typically by a developmental pediatrician/ psychologist. It entails the use of structured questionnaires and checklists covering areas like language, physical abilities, cognitive skills, as well as behavioral and emotional aspects.\nIn instances where there are concerns or if a child is at a higher risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), such as having a family member with ASD, additional screening may be recommended. It’s worth noting that developmental screening can be conducted as a standard part of a child’s regular health checkup, even if there are no apparent concerns.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends developmental and behavioral screening for all children during regular visits at the ages of 9 months 18 months and 30 months.\nIn addition, AAP recommends that all children be screened specifically for ASD during regular visits at 18 months and 24 months.\n\n\n6.3.2 Screening Instruments\nMost often the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up (MCHAT - R/F) or the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used.\n\nMCHAT is a brief checklist of yes/no items for early detection among children 16 to 30 months of age.\nChildhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) observes a child’s behavior and uses a 15-point scale to evaluate a child’s relationship to people, body use, adaptation to change, listening response, and verbal communication.\n\nA well-executed screening will determine whether a more comprehensive assessment for autism is required. Additionally, it aids in the identification or exclusion of any other potential issues or conditions that may be present.\n\n\n6.3.3 Screening outcomes and diagnosis\nParental responses in the child’s screening are highly significant. If all results are within normal parameters and parents have no concerns, that will conclude the process. However, if the child exhibits developmental challenges or if the doctor shares any concerns, they will direct the parents to a specialist for further evaluations, which may include tests to rule out other issues, such as speech-hearing impairment.\nOnce other conditions are ruled out, and the child meets the ICD (International Classification of Diseases)- 10 or DSM - 5 (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder, the child will be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).",

    "text": "6.6 Screening tools\nScreening tools are assessments that identify at risk children. Children who are found to be at risk with the screening tool, should go for further assessments. Screening tool commonly used by clinical/ developmental psychologists and psychiatrists in India is\n\n6.6.1 M-CHAT-R/F (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up)\nThe Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F; Robins, Fein, & Barton, 2009) is a two-stage parent-report screening tool designed to assess the risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The M-CHAT-R/F is freely available for download for clinical, research, and educational purposes. Here are the usage instructions:\n\nThe M-CHAT-R can be utilized and scored during routine well-child care visits, and it is also suitable for specialists and other professionals to evaluate the risk of ASD.\nThe primary objective of the M-CHAT-R is to maximize sensitivity, meaning it aims to identify as many cases of ASD as possible. Consequently, there is a relatively high rate of false positives, indicating that not all children who score as at risk will be diagnosed with ASD.\nTo address this, the Follow-Up questions (M-CHAT-R/F) have been developed. Users should be aware that even with the Follow-Up questions, a significant number of children who screen positive on the M-CHAT-R will not receive an ASD diagnosis. However, it’s important to recognize that these children are at a heightened risk for other developmental disorders or delays, making it crucial to consider further evaluation for any child who screens positive.\n\n\n\n6.6.2 Occupational Therapy Evaluation\nAs an occupational therapist (OT), the evaluation of a child with autism involves a comprehensive assessment of various domains, including social, communication, cognitive, sensory, and motor skills. It is valuable to incorporate a sensory profile of the child and consider the results of assessments conducted by other professionals. The Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) assessment conducted by an occupational therapist can take place in diverse settings, such as at home, in school, or at one of our clinics.\nDuring the ASD assessment, the occupational therapist, using their clinical expertise and specialized training, employs a combination of a sensory profile, autism checklist and clinical observation. The checklist and sensory profile is designed to gather information on how the child perceives and interacts with the world. For example, it includes questions related to the child’s comfort level in social situations, their preference for solitary play versus engaging with others, and other factors that provide insights into their sensory experiences and responses. This multidimensional assessment approach helps tailor intervention strategies to meet the child’s specific needs and challenges.\n\n\n6.6.3 Speech and Language Evaluation\nAs a Speech Language pathologist (SLP), one can conduct initial screenings to identify any communication and language delays or atypical behaviors that may be indicative of autism. SLPs can conduct comprehensive assessments to evaluate a child’s communication and language skills. This assessment may involve evaluating speech and language development, as well as social communication abilities.",

    "text": "6.7 Diagnostic tools\nIt’s important to emphasize that while SLPs and OTs are experts in the area of communication and functional skills respectively, they do not have the authority to diagnose autism. The formal diagnosis of autism is typically made by a medical professional, clinical psychologist, or developmental pediatrician based on a comprehensive evaluation that considers various factors, including communication and language development, social interactions, and repetitive behaviors.\n\n6.7.1 CARS - Childhood Rating Scale\nThe Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) has been updated as the CARS-2. The original CARS was a widely-used rating scale for autism, primarily designed for individuals with co-occurring intellectual functioning. However, it faced criticism for not accurately identifying higher-functioning individuals on the autism spectrum. The CARS-2 preserves the original CARS format for use with younger or lower-functioning individuals (now known as the CARS2-ST or “Standard Form”). Simultaneously, it introduces a distinct rating scale designed for higher-functioning individuals (referred to as the CARS2-HF or “High Functioning”).\nClinically, the original CARS was sometimes misused as a parent questionnaire, but it was originally intended as a clinician rating scale to be completed following direct observation of the child by a professional knowledgeable about autism, who had also received some brief training on how to assess the CARS items. The CARS-2 maintains this format. Parent input can be gathered using the CARS2-QPC (Questionnaire of Parent Concerns), a form that parents use to document their observations (although it is not scored).\nSpecific guidelines for usage include: + CARS2-ST can be employed with children under the age of 6, or over the age of 6 but with an estimated IQ of 79 or lower, or if there is a significant communication impairment. + CARS-HF is administered to children aged 6 or older, with an estimated IQ of 80 or higher, and who possess fluent communication skills.\n\n\n6.7.2 Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) - (ADOS; Lord, Rutter, DiLavore, Risi, 1999)\nThe Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is considered the ‘gold standard’ for assessing and diagnosing autism and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) in individuals of all ages, developmental stages, and language abilities. This semi-structured assessment is versatile and can be applied to evaluate individuals suspected of having autism, ranging from toddlers to adults, and encompassing those with a wide spectrum of language skills.\nThe ADOS comprises four distinct modules, each of which can be administered in a relatively short timeframe of 35 to 40 minutes. The module selected for assessment depends on the individual’s expressive language level and chronological age. Guided by the instructions in the manual, the appropriate module is chosen for each person. Module 1 is designed for children who do not consistently use phrase speech, Module 2 for those using phrase speech but not verbally fluent Module 3 for fluent children, and Module 4 for fluent adolescents and adults. It’s worth noting that the ADOS does not specifically address nonverbal adolescents and adults within the autism spectrum. During the ADOS assessment, there’s a 30- to 45-minute observation period that offers ample opportunities for a trained administrator to observe social and communication behaviors relevant to the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders. As the ADOS is conducted, observations are recorded and later coded to formulate a diagnosis. Cut-off scores are provided for both the broader diagnosis of PDD/atypical autism/autism spectrum and the more traditional, narrower concept of autism. By offering standardized materials and ratings, the ADOS provides an evaluation of autism spectrum disorders that remains independent of language capabilities.\n\n\n6.7.3 Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) - (ADI-R; Couteur, Lord, Rutter, 2003)\nThe Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) is a structured interview employed for the purpose of diagnosing autism, planning treatment strategies, and distinguishing autism from other developmental disorders. Having been used in research studies for many years, this comprehensive interview is an invaluable tool for conducting a thorough assessment of individuals suspected of having autism or related autism spectrum disorders. The administration and scoring of the ADI-R typically take between 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours.\nTo administer the ADI-R, a skilled clinical interviewer engages in a structured dialogue with a parent or caretaker who possesses in-depth knowledge of the developmental history and current behaviors of the individual being assessed. This interview can be utilized for assessing both children and adults, provided their mental age is above 2 years and 0 months.\nThe ADI-R consists of 93 items and focuses on three key functional domains: Language/Communication Reciprocal Social Interactions Restricted, Repetitive, and Stereotyped Behaviors and Interests\nFollowing highly standardized procedures, the interviewer records and codes the responses provided by the informant. The interview questions cover eight distinct content areas:\n\nThe subject’s background, including family, educational history, previous diagnoses, and medication use.\nAn overview of the subject’s behavior.\nEarly development and achievement of developmental milestones.\nLanguage acquisition and potential loss of language or other skills.\nCurrent functioning related to language and communication.\nSocial development and play.\nInterests and behaviors.\nClinically relevant behaviors, such as aggression, self-injury, and possible epileptic features.\n\nUnlike tests, the ADI-R is an interview process that focuses on behaviors that are uncommon in individuals not affected by autism. As a result, it yields specific results rather than relying on scales or norms. These results can be used to support a diagnosis of autism or to determine the clinical needs of various groups in which a high prevalence of autism spectrum disorders might be expected. This includes individuals with severe language impairments, certain medical conditions, congenital blindness, or those who have experienced institutional deprivation.\nHere is a comprehensive note on autism assessment, screening tools and communicating with parents.",

    "text": "6.8 Revealing the diagnosis to parents\nAbsolutely, revealing an autism diagnosis to parents is a crucial and sensitive step in the process. It’s essential for professionals to approach this conversation with empathy and provide guidance on the next steps. Here are some suggestions for professionals on how to convey the diagnosis and offer support to parents:\n\nChoose the Right Setting: Find a quiet and private space to discuss the diagnosis, ensuring that you have enough time for the conversation without interruptions.\nEmpathetic Communication: Start by expressing empathy and understanding. Acknowledge the emotions they may be experiencing, which can include relief, shock, denial, or a range of other feelings.\nProvide Information: Explain the diagnosis clearly and in simple terms. Offer educational materials or resources that parents can take home and review at their own pace. This might include brochures, websites, or books.\nAnswer Questions: Encourage parents to ask questions and address any concerns they may have. Be patient and provide honest, accurate information to the best of your knowledge.\nOffer Emotional Support: Let parents know that their feelings are valid and that they are not alone. Mention local or online support groups or organizations where they can connect with other parents in similar situations.\nDiscuss Treatment and Intervention Options: Depending on the child’s needs, provide information about available treatment and intervention options. This might include therapies like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), speech therapy, occupational therapy, and more. Discuss the benefits and potential next steps.\nReferrals: If necessary, provide referrals to specialists or service providers who can further assess and assist the child. Explain the roles of these professionals and the importance of early intervention.\nDevelop a Care Plan: Work together with the parents to create a care plan tailored to their child’s specific needs and strengths. This plan may involve therapies, educational programs, and other services.\nLegal and Financial Guidance: Discuss any legal and financial matters, such as eligibility for government programs, insurance coverage, and educational rights, to ensure parents are aware of available resources.\nEncourage Advocacy: Encourage parents to become advocates for their child’s needs and rights. Provide information about special education services, Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), and the importance of being involved in their child’s educational journey.\nRecommend Reading Materials: Suggest books, articles, or online resources that can help parents better understand autism and learn strategies for supporting their child.\nFollow-Up: Schedule a follow-up appointment to check on the family’s progress, address any new questions, and assess how the child is responding to interventions.\n\nRemember that every family’s situation is unique, and the way they react to the diagnosis can vary greatly. Your support, understanding, and guidance can make a significant difference in helping parents navigate this challenging but important phase in their child’s life.",

    "section": "6.9 Diagnosis for adults",
    "text": "6.9 Diagnosis for adults\nAutism Spectrum Disorder is a neurological condition typically identified in childhood, which may raise questions among adults about the possibility of developing autism later in life, particularly if they’ve observed symptoms resembling autism.\nDue to the basic nature of the disorder, it is not possible for adults to acquire autism. Autism arises from atypical brain development, and by adulthood, the foundational neurodevelopmental processes are already complete. Thus, it is impossible to develop autism later in life. However, autism symptoms can start to show up/ affect later in life and the diagnosis of Autism can happen late for some individuals due to a variety of reasons:\n\nMasking and Camouflaging: Many individuals, especially those with higher-functioning forms of autism, may develop coping strategies to mask their autism traits and fit in socially. This masking can make it challenging for professionals to recognize the signs of autism.\nGender Differences: Autism is often underdiagnosed in girls and women, as the diagnostic criteria were historically based on male presentations. Girls with autism may exhibit different social and behavioral traits that are less recognizable as typical autism symptoms.\nMild or Subtle Symptoms: Some individuals with autism have milder or subtler symptoms that may not be as noticeable in childhood but become more apparent as social demands increase in adolescence or adulthood.\nCo-occurring Conditions: Individuals with autism may have co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which can complicate the diagnostic process and delay recognition of autism. They are often secondary conditions that occur when the autism is left untreated. It takes a keen eye and specialist who is well-versed in the nuances of autism to identify autism symptoms in adults.\nLate Recognition of Differences: Some families and individuals may not recognize autism traits until later in life, especially if they have limited exposure to autism or were unaware of the spectrum’s diversity.\nChange in Life Circumstances: Life transitions, such as moving to a new environment, starting a new job, or entering college, can highlight social and communication challenges, prompting individuals to seek assessment and diagnosis.\nAccess to Services: Limited access to healthcare or diagnostic services can delay the identification of autism. In some regions, diagnostic resources may be limited, leading to later diagnoses.\nStigma and Misunderstanding: Social stigma or misunderstanding of autism can deter individuals and families from seeking diagnosis or support until later in life. “He/she will start talking when she is 5 or 6 years old. Their uncle/dad also started talking late only. Let’s wait.”\n\nIn most cases, it could be a combination of these reasons. The family is not aware of Autism and its symptoms, the child is bright academically and somehow manages to mask the symptoms.\nAs Samriddhi Malhotra, an individual on the autism spectrum, diagnosed in her 30s, shares: “My family couldn’t understand this because I was considered academically bright. Because of these ‘odd’ behaviours, people would say things like ‘she’s so careless and haphazard’ or ‘she’s lazy’. As an adult, I wouldn’t always understand social cues, the dynamics in a friend circle and the subtext and subtleties of what people say. But, over the years, I learnt to master them almost like a science. Piecing it together logically, like, oh, this is what people mean when they say this or that, and I learnt to adapt.”\n\n6.9.1 Signs to look out for\nSymptoms of autism in adults closely resemble those in children, such as difficulties in social situations, obsessive interests, and strict adherence to routines. Key symptoms that are often observed in adults with autism include:\n\nDifficulty understanding other people’s feelings or reactions\nSocial anxiety\nTrouble making and keeping friends\nComing off as brutally honest and not realizing they’re offending others\nNot being interested in others’ points of view or feelings\nDifficulty expressing how they feel\nInterpreting things very literally or in black and white\nStuck in having the same routine every day and being uncomfortable if it is interrupted or threatened to be changed\n\n\n\n6.9.2 Diagnostic tools\nSince symptoms are not very different from what we observe in a child, the diagnostic process would be more or less similar. In most cases of adolescents, it would be the school that first reports concerns and then with the help of a psychologist one may undergo the diagnostic process. In adults, it could pose some challenges because symptoms of other disorders could be overlapping with autism symptoms. Either ways, a combination of assessments and clinical judgements could be used to diagnose older people. Some tools are:\n\nAutism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) - (ADOS; Lord, Rutter, DiLavore, Risi, 1999) The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is considered the ‘gold standard’ for assessing and diagnosing autism and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) in individuals of all ages, developmental stages, and language abilities.\nAutism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) - (ADI-R; Couteur, Lord, Rutter, 2003) The Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) is a structured interview employed for the purpose of diagnosing autism, planning treatment strategies, and distinguishing autism from other developmental disorders.\n\nReceiving an autism diagnosis according to a recent study with 9 adults over the age of 50, was seen as a positive development that enabled them to redefine their sense of self and gain a deeper understanding of their unique requirements. Before the diagnosis of autism, they had undergone treatment for anxiety and depression. They also reported experiencing behaviors associated with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) during their childhood and often feeling isolated and aloof from others, growing up.\nAlthough most people feel relief, it may also be accompanied with a feeling of guilt or grief over their life thus far, for they have to redefine themselves and their lifestyle. Therefore, it could be helpful to continue receiving psychological support while processing the diagnosis for themselves.",

    "text": "7.1 A few key questions\nSo your child is just diagnosed with autism.\nFirst, convince yourself of the diagnosis. Take a second opinion or third opinion as necessary. Meet other parents. This is because if you are unsure of the diagnosis, you will be unsure of what to do and that will waste time. Try and understand the rationale for the diagnosis and the recommendations.\nSecond, recognise that you need help both in terms of expertise about autism and your own emotional health. You are most likely to be someone who does not know about autism. This diagnosis has come as a shock to you. You need help to make sense of it. Find support groups. Seek the help of experts, other parents, counsellors or family members. Remember that your child needs you in good shape.\nThen, recognise that the child needs help. A child with autism has a different neurology than you. She may have sensory experiences that are very overwhelming. She might be struggling with social situations, and may have communication problems. While it might be difficult for neurotypical people to imagine these problems and their severity, these difficulties are real. Traditional parenting approaches may actually make it more difficult for the child. Also, every person on the spectrum has slightly different difficulties and experiences life differently. It is important for you as a parent to learn more autism, how it is impacting your child and then help her.\nAs you go ahead and make further decisions, remember that the objective is to help the child. The child needs help with sensory experiences, social issues and communication, at the very minimum. Every decision you make should be examined in the light of this question - how is this likely to help the child?\nLook for more information to make sense of autism and what your child is going through - If you are already on this resource page, you have made a start!\nUsually, the recommendation from developmental psychologists is to start therapies. Check the therapy centres around you. Examine their credentials and choose a good therapist. Here is a note on how to choose therapists. Once again, think about their recommendations and how they are going to help your child.\nWhile the therapies and the amount of help your child needs may look overwhelming at first, a lot can be done using common sense. Think of how you can skill yourself up. What can you do at your end? In the Indian context, most institutions that deal with children - preschools, schools, activity centres etc. - do not have much understanding of the needs of children on the spectrum. Remember that you cannot help other people working with the child unless you have a good sense of your child, her difficulties and how to respond to them.\nAll of this is going to require your time. Plan such that you are able to spend time with the child, interface with therapists and gradually develop an understanding of how to help her manage her daily life.\nIn summary, take care of yourself, understand your child and continue working. You can do this.\nHere is a short note on a few key questions parents tend to have when their child is diagnosed.\nFirst is a set of questions like what caused my child’s autism, is it my fault etc. This [note] (https://disability.farmhill.in/disability-guides/autism/identification-causes.html#what-causes-autism) talks about causes of autism. Hopefully, it will answer some of your questions and set you on the path of action.",

    "text": "7.1.1 Preschool versus therapies\nAnother question is about preschool versus therapies. Parents usually think that the child needs to go to preschool. There is a belief that going to school and mingling with other children will help the child learn social and other skills. There is merit to this thought provided the child has the necessary skills and temperament. However, most of the children tend to need therapy help with basic social and communication aspects like greeting others, being around others, pointing to what they want, saying yes or no etc. Many children also tend to have sensory issues around sound, touch, smell, space etc. In such cases, it is a good idea to get help for the child and ensure she is comfortable in the preschool environment. Otherwise, just sending the child to school and bringing her back may not be helpful. Also, going to an environment which she does not feel comfortable in but is compelled to perform one way or the other can have long term negative consequences.\n\n\n7.1.2 School readiness\nAnother area where parents tend to be anxious is the school readiness of the child. Most parents believe that going to school is a necessary part of a child’s life. So, when their three year old is diagnosed with autism, one of their goals is to equip the child with basic skills needed to go to a preschool or school. Some of these skills include basic rule following, sitting in one place, playing nicely, being social with other children, etc. Some parents also believe it is important for their children to learn academic skills like reciting the alphabet, a few rhymes etc.\nWhile going to school may help a child acquire a set of necessary skills, children on the spectrum often do not learn by imitating others. They need help with navigating day to day environments due to their sensory and communication challenges. Many children tend to engage in what we think of as inappropriate behaviours - screaming, biting, scratching, just following someone around, watching things go round and round, flapping, constantly humming, zoning out etc. These are all their responses to the difficulties they are facing.\nIn such a scenario, it is more important to address the child’s primary difficulties and equip her with some basic skills before sending her to an environment like a preschool.\nIn summary, once again, the answer to whether a child should go to preschool or learn to be school ready depends on the same question - is it good for this child? If the child is able to navigate the environment, then the answer is yes. Else, no.",

    "text": "8.1 Early Intervention Goals\nOnce a child is diagnosed with autism and the parents have made some sort of peace with the diagnosis, the next question is, what do we do to help the child?\nThis is when we talk about a variety of approaches called ‘early interventions.’ Early interventions like occupational therapy, speech therapy, and in some cases behavioral therapy are routinely recommended for children on the autism spectrum. A variety of other supplemental approaches like play therapy, music therapy, art therapy and in some cases horse therapy, water therapy and horticulture therapy are also offered.\nHere is a video on Early Intervention from Unmeed Child Development Center based in Mumbai. This video is about the importance of observing the developments in the first 3 years of a child’s life, outcomes of early intervention and the many roles therapists play.\nHere is a brief summary of the video:\nHowever, before we go further into what these therapies are and how to choose them, it may help to stop and ask what our goals are while we put the child through these early interventions. Yes, the child is on the spectrum, yes, she has certain challenges but then, what should early intervention help the child with? Once we are clear about the goals of for the child, we can go ahead and talk about choosing interventions accordingly.\nTo start with, early childhood development goals for children on the spectrum are not different from the same goals for children in general. In both cases, one is looking for development along physical, social, cognitive, and emotional dimensions. However, children on the spectrum are likely to have a variety of specific challenges in these areas, and therefore, the goals are likely to be more specific. They may also find it difficult to learn these behaviors from the environment by observing and copying adults and other children, and so, may need suitably designed interventions and therapies.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "8.1.1 Communication Goals\nChildren on the spectrum tend to face challenges related to speech, language, and communication. Some children may not be able to speak at all, due to poor motor coordination and other physical and neurological difficulties. Some children may be able to produce all sounds but limit their verbal interaction to a few words and not sentences. In some cases, children may be able to produce language fluently, as in be able to speak full sentences, recite poems etc. but may not be able to use language to communicate by asking questions, making observations etc. Many children may not understand verbal inputs and instructions. Some may be able to understand but may not be able to respond. Even in cases where children are unable to speak, they may show a willingness to communicate if the speech barrier is removed. In most cases, parents manage by trying to guess what the child means or wants. As the child grows up, this does not work and the inability to communicate leads to anxiety and other difficulties. So, an important goal is to help children develop a channel for two-way communication either using speech or using other alternative forms of communication.\n\n\n8.1.2 Social Goals\nChildren on the spectrum also have a variety of social difficulties, starting with not responding when parents call their name, not being able to interact with parents. Children may not want to interact with peers or may not know how to take part in interactive games. They may behave inappropriately as they do not understand the rules of social behavior. For example, when in a play area, they may just follow other children around, copy their actions or snatch toys from others. So, teaching appropriate social behaviors and helping children cope with the demands of everyday social interactions at home, play areas and public places is another goal.\n\n\n8.1.3 Physical Goals\nChildren on the spectrum may have physical challenges, with movement and balance. For example, many children walk on their toes, or find it difficult to hold erect posture while walking. Some are not able to balance naturally and so might find it difficult to walk up and down stairs, step over small obstacles like doorsteps etc. A few children may experience significant difficulties in coordinating their movements, to the extent of not being able to move around or use their hands without assistance. Many children also present with low muscle tone and overall poor motor coordination. One of the goals of early intervention is to help children develop better motor coordination and be able to navigate their world comfortably.\n\n\n8.1.4 Sensory Goals\nChildren also present a variety of sensory challenges. Due to their neurological uniqueness, some children may have a different sensory experience than others. For example, some children are overly sensitive to the sound of a pressure cooker whistling. They may close their ears, run away, or show other unusual forms of distress around the noise. Some children find it difficult to handle different textures either to touch or to mouth. They may refuse to eat certain kinds of foods and may prefer to stick to one or two items of food. This preference might pose significant challenges when children end up eating only chicken nuggets or fruits and milk for years together. The interventions we choose need to address the sensory challenges of the child.\n\n\n8.1.5 Behavioral and Emotional Goals\nThey may also experience a variety of behavioral and emotional challenges. Many children do not like to be disturbed when they are engaged in an activity and may find it difficult to transition from one activity or physical space to another. For example, a child might go to the play area and might resist coming back home. Or she might be playing with toys and may resist moving to the dining area for lunch. Children may also appear to not understand emotions – they find it challenging to read the emotion from facial expression and body language. Young children may not have enough linguistic and cognitive ability to understand emotions in the abstract. Guiding and helping children manage these variety of challenges needs to be among the goals of early intervention.",

    "text": "8.2 Key Focus\nIt is important to understand that the way a child experiences autism and the way it shows up through her behavior in the environment, comes from a combination of multiple factors. A child may not like the texture of food presented to her, may have a severe sensory response to it and may start feeling distressed. Now, she does not have language or other tools to communicate the same, does not understand the social behavior expected of her, and may start experiencing a serious emotional response. When a helpful adult tries to touch her, feed her, or talk to her, the added physical and verbal inputs further aggravate her distress. If she does not get help at this stage, she may resort to what is seen as ‘inappropriate behavior’ to communicate her distress. For the others around her, it looks like the child was offered tasty food, was encouraged to try out and taste it, but instead of doing what is expected, she has started closing her ears, shouting, kicking, and throwing the food around. However, the way she experiences the entire interaction is hugely different.\nAs we have seen above, these difficulties sometimes work together to produce profoundly difficult outcomes, and it is important to take all these areas into account while planning the goals for early intervention. The focus is to understand the variety of ways the child is distressed by the environment, trace the distress back to various difficulties the child has, and try address these difficulties, while building her skills and competencies.",

    "text": "8.3 Choosing therapies\nAs discussed abovce, early intervention approaches need to address language and communication, social, physical, sensory, behavioral, and emotional goals. One therapy or approach is unlikely to address all these goals. Usually, a combination of behavior therapy like ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis), Speech and Language Therapy and Occupational Therapy are recommended. In addition, there are many other options like art therapy, music therapy, play therapy, animal therapy and so on. In the Indian context, there are alternatives like homeopathy, ayurveda and other traditional medicines. In addition, there are approaches like supplementary diets, medicines etc.\nIn this era of internet, news media and social media, each of these proven or unproven treatments are promoted through stories of success. Also, since every person’s autism is unique, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to address the needs of every person on the spectrum. There is an overwhelming amount of information available, and making an informed decision becomes a challenge.\n\n8.3.1 A few guidelines\nYou should learn to critically evaluate the information you receive. Get information from objective sources.\n\nPeople promoting various treatments may really want to help your child but may also have additional business motives.\nAnyone making claims about “complete recovery” from autism or “curing” autism should be viewed with suspicion. There are no cures for autism.\nThe therapy approaches you choose should be evidence based. This means there should be enough scientific evidence that the approach works. Please remember that anecdotes are not evidence. Evidence-based practices include behavior approaches, developmental approaches like speech language therapy and occupational therapy.\nThe therapy approach or the combination of approaches you choose should be able to address all the goals mentioned above for the child. The therapy approach should enable you to get an assessment of your child’s specific needs in each of these areas and provide a comprehensive plan to progress on each of them.\nThe demands of the therapy approach should be aligned with your family’s capacity. For example, if a therapy approach needs you to spend more time with the child, you need to think of whether you can do this or not. It should also suit your financial ability.\nComplimentary approaches involving working with art, music, movement, animals, swimming, play should be treated as complimentary therapies. These can be practiced in addition to the evidence-based early intervention approaches above.\nMost methods of working with autism work slowly compared to the quick results one expects from medical treatments. That is the way it is. Anyone making time bound promises like “making your child school ready in six months” needs to be evaluated with caution.\nSince there are no medicines for the core symptoms of autism, one needs to be cautious about medication as a solution. Please evaluate the medication carefully. With young children, it may be best to avoid medication except in case of severe medical conditions like seizures.\nExtra caution is advised in using medication from ayurveda and other traditional medical systems. Most of these medications may be untested and unproven. Homeopathy may also be approached with caution – there are many controversies about whether it works at all. One of the problems with relying on unproven alternatives and medications is that these practices distract the family, divert attention from what needs to be done and may even interfere with the therapies.\nSimilarly, the efficacy of diets and supplements is at best questionable. An additional problem with restrictive diets is that children end up being deprived of many commonly consumed food items and may be nutritionally impacted. This feeling of deprivation may result in behaviors like grabbing food from others. Additionally, in the Indian culture where most social occasions revolve around food, children may also be socially impacted. While putting a child on a diet may look like an easy option, it may end up having profound consequences.\n\nIn summary, the key to choosing a good approach is to go with one that is evidence based, addresses the development needs of the child, and suits the family circumstances.",

    "section": "8.4 Choosing a service provider",
    "text": "8.4 Choosing a service provider\nAfter understanding the goals of early intervention and how to choose a therapy approach comes the question of how to choose a service provider for the therapy delivery and what to expect as you start working with them. Here are some thoughts that can help.\n\n8.4.1 Multifunctional Approach\nAs we saw earlier, all the goals and needs of a child cannot be addressed by one therapy or approach. When working with multiple therapy providers, the parents end up having to coordinate between different therapists. In such cases, it is important to ensure the therapists are willing to work with you for this purpose. A better case would be when therapists are willing to talk to each other. The best is when a single service provider brings together the multifunctional team needed to meet all the therapy needs of your child.\n\n\n8.4.2 Family Centred\nWhile it is the individual with autism that receives the therapy, it is the entire family that is dealing with autism. A service provider willing to take a family centric approach should be preferred. The service provider should understand the importance of co-opting the family, keeping them involved, and support and train them, as necessary. Parental involvement and training become especially important when young children are involved as the children may benefit more when therapists and parents understand each other and work together.\n\n\n8.4.3 Assessments and plans\nWhen the therapy providers start working with your child, they should assess your child’s needs and develop an Individual Education Plan. Please ask the service providers what kinds of assessments they conduct to ensure they identify the specific needs and goals of your child. These assessments are necessary, so an individually designed therapy plan is developed for your child. This plan should also include details of how they plan to track and communicate the progress to you. Please insist that this plan be made and shared with you in a reasonable time. It is also important that the providers explain this plan to you in a way you can understand. Ideally, this plan should include your input and requirements as well.\n\n\n8.4.4 Clear communication\nAt all points of time, the service providers should provide clear and transparent communication regarding the goals, the program, and the progress. Service providers should be willing to include parents and other caregivers in the therapy program.\n\n\n8.4.5 Respect and dignity\nAny practice that does not respect the individual with autism and the caregivers needs to be questioned. Individuals need to be treated with dignity and respect, irrespective of the goals and efficacy of the therapy. Parents and caregivers must be treated with respect and recommendations delivered respectfully. Most importantly individuals and parents should never feel pressurized or bullied by professionals.\n\n\n8.4.6 Training and qualifications\nWhether the therapy is provided by a single provider or by different providers, it is important for the parents to ensure that the therapists are well trained and qualified to deliver the therapy. Please do not hesitate to ask for details of certification and training.\n\n\n8.4.7 References and history\nWhen choosing a service provider, please ask for references and learn about the experience of other parents who have worked with them before. Please learn about how the providers deal with children, parental questions, and concerns and what the outcomes of the therapy were.\nIn summary, the therapy provider you choose should take a multifunctional approach, involve the family, provide comprehensive therapy plans and progress tracking and be respectful to the individual with autism and the family.",

    "text": "8.5 Autism, Speech and Communication\nOne of the key features of autism is communication challenges. These include not understanding the importance of communication, not being able or willing to communicate, not being able to communicate appropriately in social situations, etc.\nIn addition, an estimated 25 to 35 percent of people on the autism spectrum have little or no functional speech. Speech in autism is also along a wide spectrum, including those that speak fluently to those that do not speak at all. The usual words used in this regard are – minimally verbal for someone who uses little speech, nonverbal for someone with no speech and preverbal for young children.\nLike in many areas related to autism, the current research on non-speaking autism is limited, and we do not really know what causes functional speech difficulties. A variety of causes for limited speech in autism are possible: auditory processing, the system in brain that interprets words, might be poor; there could be motor planning issues like speech apraxia that impacts peoples’ ability to plan and coordinate mouth and tongue movements; differences in brain anatomy in the speech production network can also be involved.\n\n8.5.1 Communication is not just speech\nHowever, there is a difference between speech and communication – speech is the ability to produce words, whereas communication is the ability to convey and receive meaning. It is a misconception that children who do not speak cannot understand or communicate. It is also not true that those that can speak can automatically communicate and understand others. Also, people who do not or cannot speak do not have less intelligence scores than those who speak. They need communication as much as anyone else.\nLiving in a world that revolves around language, speech and communication can be particularly challenging for people on the spectrum and more so for those that do not use much speech. The current assumption is that people who cannot communicate become frustrated and that becomes a trigger for various other unhelpful behaviors. Whether it is completely true or not, there is broad agreement among experts that having a two-way communication channel is important for everyone.\n\n\n8.5.2 Looking beyond speech - AAC\nSpeech is particularly difficult for some people on the spectrum. We do not understand the reasons for these difficulties, but recognize that effective communication is important for everyone, and that speech is not the only way to communicate. It therefore makes sense to look beyond speech and enable everyone to find a channel of communication, using augmented and alternative communication (AAC) as necessary. AAC is a broad category that includes sign language, gestures, pictures, written words, and electronic devices.\nThis is not to say that speech is not necessary or important. Speaking and understanding spoken language can make life significantly easier for people on the spectrum and their families. However, considering the difficulties they have with communication and speech, limiting oneself to speech-only approaches can be counterproductive. It is advisable to explore the use of AAC for communication, as early as possible.\nAAC can provide a communication channel for people on the spectrum who have difficulties with speech and communication. It has been shown that even with people who speak, the use of AAC can make communication more effective, by providing a necessary scaffold. Also, the common apprehension that use of AAC stops children from acquiring speech is not true, as shown by a 2021 study, among others.\nIn summary, communication is a key element of working with autism and needs to be highly prioritized. People who find it difficult to speak should be supported with augmented and alternative communication as needed.",

    "text": "8.7 Speech Therapy is not just about speech\nYes, speech therapy and speech therapists are not all about “speech.” A speech therapist is really a speech language pathologist (SLP), but they are not just about language either. The overall goal of SLPs is to help a person communicate in functional ways.\nCommunicating in functional ways certainly includes learning to use speech and language for communication but may also include learning to read nonverbal communication like facial expressions and gestures, learning to communicate in social situations etc. When working with people on the spectrum, the focus of SLPs is to holistically improve the ability to communicate and that may include using augmented and alternative communication (AAC).\nCommunication and speech related challenges vary widely from person to person on the autism spectrum. Some individuals may not be able to produce any sounds, some may be able to produce speech but may not be able to use it to communicate, and at the other end, some may be able to speak fluently yet may have difficulty sticking to a topic or communicating appropriately. Accordingly, SLPs perform a variety of functions.\n\n8.7.1 Functions of Speech Therapists\n\nPrelinguistic skills – help children learn skills like eye contact, gestures, vocalizations\nNonverbal communication – help people learn to notice nonverbal signs in a conversation\nFeeding interventions – some individuals tend to have difficulties with chewing, swallowing etc. Some SLPs are trained to help in these areas.\nAssisted and Augmented Communication (AAC) - SLPs can also train people in using AACs to communicate. These may include Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), sign language or electronic devices.\nSpeech fluency – SLPs can help people on the spectrum with speech clarity, and fluency.\nArticulation – Speech requires coordination of different structures. SLPs can help improve the muscle strength, coordination and manipulation needed to produce speech.\nGrammar – many children on the spectrum struggle with grammar and sentence structure. SLPs can help them understand language\nFunctional Speech – echolalia, repetition of sounds, words and phrases is a common coping mechanism. SLPs can help in building functional speech.\nSocial skills – SLPs can help coach people on the spectrum to communicate in different settings, either in one-to-one sessions or group sessions.\nSocial communication – SLPs can help children use language for different purposes like demanding, informing, commenting.\nTransition to work – SLPs can also continue to help as the individual transitions to a work environment by coaching how to communicate in written and spoken forms.\n\nWhen working with an individual on the autism spectrum, SLPs assess strengths and challenges and develop a program with goals for the person and the approaches to achieve them. This program then becomes the basis for working together and assessing the effectiveness of the therapy.\nParents of children on the spectrum should understand that the goal of the SLP is to facilitate communication and be willing to prioritize functional communication. A two-way channel of communication is the most important need of a child on the spectrum.\n\n\n8.7.2 Choosing an SLP\n\nSLP is an important member of the team of experts working with your child. Choose someone whose program matches your priorities and goals.\nRemember that functional communication is the priority, over speech or being able to repeat rhymes or learning alphabet.\nEnsure the SLP is willing to work with other experts either directly or through you.\nWork towards building transparency in your relationship with the SLP. You should know what is happening in the session and be trained to carry out some interventions at home, as needed.\nChoose someone who can help with AAC as needed, training you, the child and others who interact with the child.\n\nIn summary, speech therapy is not just about speech or language but about holistic communication. A speech therapist is an important member of the team working with your child and should be chosen carefully to align with the child’s goals and requirements.",

    "section": "8.8 Occupational Therapy",
    "text": "8.8 Occupational Therapy\nMay people on the autism spectrum face motor difficulties. They may have gross motor difficulties, such as a clumsy way of walking or difficulty with large motor movements or difficulties with fine motor skills like writing, coloring in the line or using scissors. Some may have trouble coordinating movements between the right and left sides of the body making it difficult to skip, jump, hop or get down the stairs. Some others may have trouble with hand-eye coordination making it difficult to catch a ball, hit a ball with a bat etc.\nIn addition to these motor difficulties, children on the spectrum may also struggle with low muscle tone, sensory processing issues (too much or too little response to sensory inputs such as sound, touch, smell etc.), as well as difficulties with proprioception and interoception.\nIt has been estimated in a 2020 study conducted in the US that as many as 87% of children between 5 and 15 years of age on the spectrum face motor difficulties. Yet, only about 30% of the children were receiving any therapy for the same.\nMotor issues may appear in infancy where 1-month old infants who are later diagnosed with autism move their arms less, they may struggle to keep their head in line with shoulders when pulled up to sit at 4 months and may struggle to stand at 14 months.\nPoor motor skills may contribute to and accentuate autism traits as motor issues can delay babbling, gesturing, and acquisition of new vocabulary. Lack of motor skills may also elicit less interaction from caregivers and provide children less prompts for learning. Poor motor skills later in childhood may make children on the spectrum reluctant to participate in physical activities, limiting opportunities for social interaction. Bad handwriting can impact academic performance. Since visual-motor integration skills are important for imitation and learning from others, lack of these skills can hamper social development. Thus, motor difficulties might have cascading effects on cognitive, social, and emotional development.\nThat is why occupational Therapy is among the top therapies recommended for autism. The general focus of occupational therapy is to improve the client’s ability to participate in activities of daily living, which may include things like schoolwork to dressing and brushing teeth.\nWhen an occupational therapist starts working with a child, they usually assess their support needs. They may use some tests like the school function assessment test (SFA), Children’s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment/Preference for Activities of Children (CAPE/PAC), Assessment of Life Habits (Life-H), Children Movement Assessment Battery for Children Second Edition (Movement ABC2), Sensory Integration and Praxis Test (SIPT) etc. In addition, the therapist may observe the child in a range of settings to see if they are able to complete tasks of daily living. For example, they may watch to see if a child can button a jacket, cut with scissors, play appropriately in the playground, etc.\nOnce the tests and observations are complete, they develop an individual plan for the child. The plan is personal and may include academic goals like using scissors, printing letters, using a paint brush; daily living skills like brushing teeth, zipping jacket, tying shoes; social functioning goals like catching a ball, jumping on trampoline etc.\nOccupational therapists usually work with the children in occupational therapy rooms or sensory rooms equipped with exercise balls, swings, jump ropes and other equipment. Therapists use techniques to strengthen the child’s hands, legs, and core, provide tools like weighted vests or large pencils to make some tasks easier etc.\nThe role of occupational therapists is not limited to working with children. They may work with adults to build living skills like cooking, cleaning etc. They may help with designing more comfortable workstations and equipment for adults working in offices. They can help in various areas of self-care, productivity, and leisure.\n\n8.8.1 Sensory Processing and Occupational Therapy\nWe rely on the information coming from our senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) to make sense of the environment around us. People on the autism spectrum may have difficulties dealing with the information coming in from different senses. A child may be distracted by the noise of a drill that you can barely hear. Another child may be feeling uncomfortable with the shirt label scratching on their neck. Yet another child might be getting overwhelmed with the perfume in the air. Too much sensory information can cause stress, anxiety, and physical pain. This can result in withdrawal, distressed behavior, or meltdowns.\n\n\n8.8.2 Different sensory profiles\nPeople on the autism spectrum can be under sensitive, oversensitive or both (at separate times) to any of their senses. For example, people who are under sensitive to sight may not have a good depth perception and may not be able to catch or throw. Those who are oversensitive may find it difficult to sleep even with a little light around. People who are under sensitive to sound may prefer crowded, noisy places or bang doors and objects. Those that are oversensitive to sound may not be able to filter our background noises, leading to difficulties in concentrating. People under sensitive to smell may sometimes lick things to get a better sense. Those that are oversensitive may have difficulties using toilets or may dislike people with distinctive, strong perfumes. People under sensitive to taste may like very spicy food. They may also eat or mouth non-edible items such as stones, dirt, soil, feces etc. This is known as pica. People with sensitivities to taste may end up with a restrictive diet. People under sensitive to touch may hold others tightly, enjoy heavy objects like weighted blankets on top of them. They may have a high pain tolerance and may self-harm. Those oversensitive to touch may not like to be touched and may have difficulties brushing and washing hair. They may also tolerate only certain types of clothing or textures.\n\n\n8.8.3 Working with sensory processing\nIn general, people who are under sensitive to a sense seek out more of that sensory input to calm themselves, to relieve anxiety and sometime just for pleasure and relaxation. Those that are oversensitive try to avoid that sensory input for the fear of being overwhelmed. People on the spectrum may need help in handling these sensitivities. The general approach is to provide manageable alternatives to the under sensitive system and to slowly desensitize the oversensitive system through gradual exposure. For example, if a child is easily overwhelmed by sounds, she may close her ears every time someone speaks to her, losing out on useful information and learning opportunities. The therapy approach in this case would be to offer her earmuffs that can decrease the intensity of the noise, couple the sound input with a visual and gradually help the child be comfortable with the sound of spoken voice. A child who is under sensitive to touch may keep scratching walls or rough surfaces for stimulation, causing injury to fingers and nails in the process. In this case, the therapist may offer a manageable alternative by giving her a polystyrene sheet to scratch and get the sensory input.\n\n\n8.8.4 Sensory Integration Therapy\nOccupational therapists trained in dealing with sensory processing difficulties can help by providing interventions to target each sense, helping the child’s nervous system become more organized and regulated. Sensory integration therapy is one of the names given to such an approach. One of the options is to put a child on a sensory diet, a specially designed daily activity plan that provides the child with a variety of sensory activities. The focus is to help the child be regulated and improve attention and focus. When the child’s arousal level is too low, they can be given stimulating activities like dancing, singing, light exercise etc. When the arousal level is high, they can be given calming activities like going for a walk, reading, listening to music etc. It is important to choose activities that suit each child and provide the appropriate level of arousal or relaxation.\n\n\n8.8.5 Sensory Circuits\nSensory circuits are another tool used by therapists to help children achieve a ready-to-learn state. Each session includes three elements.\n\nAlerting activities to stimulate the body’s central nervous system in preparation for learning. For example, spinning, bouncing on a gym ball, skipping, star jumps\nOrganizing activities which demand brain and body to work together. For example, balancing on a wobble board, log rolling, juggling\nCalming activities give an awareness of their body in space and increase the ability to self-regulate sensory input. For example, heavy muscle work and deep pressure like wall pushes, pushups, using weights.\n\nIn summary, some people on the spectrum may have sensory processing difficulties that make it difficult for them to process sensory information. Occupational therapists trained in sensory integration can help by designing sensory diets and other programs that can help children be more regulated, calmer, and focused, thereby reducing anxiety and increasing opportunities to thrive and achieve in the overwhelming environment in which we now live.",

    "section": "8.9 Beyond the five senses",
    "text": "8.9 Beyond the five senses\nWe are all familiar with the five senses – sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. However, there are three other senses that are not as well known. In the context of autism, it is important to know about these senses as people on the spectrum tend to experience processing difficulties related to these senses as well.\nThe three other senses are – Proprioception, Interoception and Vestibular system. Proprioception is our body’s intrinsic ability to sense and position itself in space. We have a set of sensory receptors in our muscles, joints, and tendons, that help us with full-body awareness. Interoception is our ability to sense our internal body states and emotional states, using the information we receive from receptors on our internal organs. The vestibular system is in our inner ear and helps us with our sense of balance and body control.\n\n8.9.1 Proprioception\nPeople on the spectrum can have proprioceptive difficulties that make it difficult for them to apply the right amount of pressure for a task. They also bump into things often and may have difficulties walking up and down stairs. They may struggle while feeding themselves, and frequently miss the mouth. They may also struggle with posture and movement fluidity when faced with a new motor task. They may underperform in sports and may struggle to remember the body posture associated with a new skill.\nProprioception difficulties can be addressed by occupational therapists using sensory integration techniques and practicing gross and fine motor movements with visual assistance like looking into a mirror while performing a task.\n\n\n8.9.2 Interoception\nRegarding interoception, people on the spectrum may be less aware of what is happening inside their bodies. The interoception center in our brains is called the insular cortex, which also plays a vital role in the perception of pain, primary emotions like joy, anger, awareness of bodily states like feeling of cold, and in the perception of being a self. Therefore, interoception difficulties may be responsible for emotional processing issues, problems in identifying and describing emotions, and difficulty with empathy and perspective taking. At an extremely basic level, people on the spectrum may not be able to recognize when they are thirsty, or hungry. They may not realize when they are full and may tend to overeat. They may find it difficult to self-regulate their emotions, attention, and behaviors. They may not be able to point to the source of their discomfort like where the pain is.\nInteroception can be improved by practicing interoception awareness activities like guided self-body scans, deep breathing, guided progressive relaxation. Young children may need support with the help of timers for eating, drinking and toileting, portion control to help eat for balanced nutrition etc.\n\n\n8.9.3 Vestibular system\nThe vestibular system refers to the structures in the inner ear that detect movement and change in the position of the head. This is the system that tells us if our head is upright or tilted, even with our eyes closed. Children who are oversensitive to this system can have fearful responses to ordinary movement activities like swings, slides, ramps etc. They may appear clumsy and fearful of moving in space. However, some children may actively seek intense sensory experiences such as excessive whirling, jumping, climbing heights, etc. Vestibular dysfunction can cause postural instability, gait dysfunction and impaired gaze. This can lead to delayed milestones such as sitting and walking and poor motor coordination. Vestibular dysfunction may be accompanied by auditory sensitivity and dysfunction.\nRepetitive actions like mild rocking can help calm down an over stimulated vestibular system. Providing structured activities that satisfy an under sensitive system seeking stimulation can also help.\nIn summary, the sensory processing disorder, and related difficulties in autism go beyond the five better known senses and may impact proprioception, interoception and vestibular system. The impact of these dysfunctions is still being researched and understood. An occupational therapist can provide sensory integration therapy to help with these difficulties.",

An approach that might have been effective for a different condition that appears to be related may be tried. For example, in the case of COVID, when the infection hit, there was no cure. Healthcare workers primarily focused on providing symptomatic treatment and tried approaches that worked for other infections and respiratory conditions like flu. A variety of treatments ranging from allopathy, ayurveda to homeopathy were tried before a vaccine was developed and a protocol that works was devised.\n\n\n9.1.2 Seeking better results with less effort\nEven when some understanding and evidence-based interventions are available, there might be a desire to seek alternative solutions in the hope of achieving better or anticipated results, and with lesser effort. For example, it is understood that diabetes cannot be cured but can be managed with lifestyle changes. Many people find these lifestyle changes difficult to make and maintain. They seek alternative approaches instead.\n\n\n9.1.3 Inability to critically evaluate\nIt is also possible that people may not have the mental capacity to critically evaluate the feasibility of promised cures versus the potential harm as they deal with the stress placed by the condition they are dealing with. Sometimes they also believe that they have tried everything there is to try and there is no harm in trying one more thing.

    "text": "9.2 The case of autism\nMany of these factors seem to be working in the case of people who are willing to try alternative treatments for autism. Autism has been a poorly understood condition whose cause is not clearly known. It impacts children and it is no secret that many of us do not understand parenting, education and child development well enough. When a child is diagnosed with autism, parents do not immediately understand all the implications and its lifelong impact. Many see it as improper behavior on the child’s part or a set of symptoms that are preventing the child from going to school and seek to address them quickly, in time for the child to join a school. They also hear from healthcare professionals that there is no medical cure for autism. The evidence based interventions are behavioral, requiring significant time, energy and resource commitment from everyone involved. Most people are stressed out with the effort of bringing up the child and an autism diagnosis just makes things worse.\nIt is in such an environment that alternative approaches, promising cures or at least significant improvements quickly, with little or no effort, become popular. Some of these are approaches that work for another condition, e.g. chelation, which is a treatment for heavy metal toxicity. Chelation was tried for autism initially because symptoms of autism resembled mercury poisoning and later because people believed autism was caused by mercury from vaccines. Similarly, hyperbaric oxygen therapy works for traumatic brain injury and was tried for autism because people believed increasing oxygen supply to the brain can help autism. There is homeopathy, which has been tried for everything that is not well understood in current medical science. In the Indian context, there is ayurveda, siddha and other alternative systems offering everything from remedies to cures for autism. Many others like restrictive diets are approaches that claim to cure a wide variety of conditions.",

It can have dangerous side effects.\n\n\n\n9.6.1 What is chelation?\nIn chelation, the aim is to administer medications (chelators) that bind with metals in the body and remove it from the system via urine when the medicine itself is excreted. This has been useful to treat heavy metal toxicity. Most commonly used medications are dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). This treatment is typically administered intravenously or orally under medical supervision following a detailed baseline assessment of metal content in the system, usually with a urine test.\n\n\n9.6.2 History of chelation\nChelation process dates back to 1935 when it was used as binding and extracting agent of calcium in the dyeing industry. The use of Chelation therapy in humans started between the 1950s and 1960s when it was used in patients with hypercalcemia and lead poisoning, consequently showing improvements in their cardiovascular condition. Since then it has been established as an effective treatment for lead poisoning or any heavy metal toxicity for that matter and as anticoagulants. Between 2002 and 2007, despite several warnings and prohibitions by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), chelation gained popularity in the U.S. for treating heart conditions and other health issues.\nHowever, due to its intensity and potential harmful side effects, it is strictly administered under medical supervision. In 1989, a “Protocol for the Safe and Effective Administration of EDTA” was established and later updated. This comprehensive protocol establishes strict criteria for patient selection and urges clinicians to conduct an initial assessment of renal function using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. It further emphasizes the continuous monitoring of renal function throughout a series of chelation treatments. Additionally, emergency procedures are outlined in case of adverse reactions during the process.\n\n\n9.6.3 Why was Chelation tried for autism?\nIt gained attention in the context of autism due to concerns about heavy metal toxicity in the systems of individuals in the spectrum, but scientific research hasn’t supported the theory that autism is caused by heavy metal toxicity. Some studies have suggested that children with autism may have higher levels of certain heavy metals in their systems, but the direct cause between heavy metal exposure and autism has not been established. One hypothesis that autism is caused due to exposure to heavy metals (mercury) through vaccines has been studied thoroughly and research suggests no causal link between vaccines and autism. Other theories of autism being caused due to intrauterine or environmental exposure to heavy metals is still under study and there is no established link as of now.\nOn the other hand, scientific research investigating the effectiveness of chelation therapy for autism remains limited and inconclusive. Clinical trials investigating the impact of chelation on autism symptoms have shown mixed or inconclusive results, and many of these studies have methodological limitations.\n\n\n9.6.4 Caution\nChelation therapy can be risky and has the potential for serious side effects such as hypocalcaemia (level of calcium in blood is too low), renal impairment and reported deaths. The presence of certain metals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, chromium, potassium, sodium, and zinc is essential to facilitate normal biological functioning of the human body. It is a cause for concern if there are lower or higher levels of these metals than what is required. It necessitates meticulous and supervised administration of medications to avoid excessive removal of metals. Medical organizations do not recommend chelation therapy for autism due to safety concerns.\nSome researchers also suggest that due to the greater risks associated with chelation compared to its efficacy as a treatment for autism, it is advisable to first establish a definitive causal link between heavy metals and autism. This approach emphasizes the need to first validate the relationship between heavy metal exposure and autism before further studying on chelation as a treatment.\nTherefore, it is crucial for anyone, whether medical professionals or families, considering chelation therapy to conduct a thorough baseline assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the treatment before proceeding with it. There is no medical organization that is in favor of using chelation therapy for autism.",

    "text": "9.7 Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nMMS is not recommended for autism. It can have dangerous side effects.\n\n\nMiracle Mineral Solution (MMS) is a controversial substance promoted in alternative health circles. Marketed as a cure for various ailments, MMS is a combination of sodium chlorite and citric acid, creating chlorine dioxide. Advocates claim it can treat conditions like malaria, cancer, and even autism. However, its use is highly controversial and poses serious health risks.\n\n9.7.1 MMS and Autism\nMMS has been suggested as a remedy for autism, asserting its ability to alleviate symptoms and enhance well-being in individuals on the autism spectrum. It’s essential to note that there is no scientific evidence supporting MMS for autism, and major health organizations strongly advise against its use.\n\n\n9.7.2 History\nMiracle Mineral Solution (MMS) , found in 2006 by Jim Humble, has a controversial history, marked by its promotion as a supposed cure for various illnesses despite serious health risks associated with its use. Here’s a brief overview of the history of MMS:\n\nOrigins in Water Purification: MMS is derived from sodium chlorite, a chemical used in some industrial applications, including water purification. It was first promoted by Jim Humble, a former Scientologist, who claimed to have discovered its health benefits during a mining expedition in South America.\nPromotion as a Health Supplement: Jim Humble initially marketed MMS as a health supplement with the claim that it could cure numerous diseases, including malaria, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and more. He founded the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing to promote MMS as a sacrament.\nClaims for Autism and Other Conditions: Over time, MMS gained attention as a purported treatment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental conditions. Despite lacking scientific evidence, some individuals and groups advocated for its use in the autism community, claiming improvements in symptoms.\nLegal Actions and Warnings: Regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health agencies worldwide, raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of MMS. The FDA issued warnings about the potential dangers of consuming MMS, emphasizing its corrosive nature and adverse health effects.\nLegal Challenges: Legal actions were taken against individuals and organizations promoting MMS as a cure for various illnesses. Authorities cracked down on the sale and distribution of MMS, emphasizing its lack of approval for medical use and the risks it posed to public health.\nGlobal Controversy: MMS gained international attention and sparked controversy, with health agencies in multiple countries issuing advisories against its use. The substance became a focal point in debates about pseudoscience, unproven treatments, and the potential exploitation of vulnerable populations.\nContinued Advocacy Despite Warnings: Despite widespread condemnation and legal actions, there are continued reports of individuals advocating for and using MMS. Online platforms have been used to disseminate information about MMS, leading to ongoing concerns about its accessibility and use.\nEthical Considerations: The promotion of MMS for serious medical conditions, including autism, raises ethical concerns within the medical and scientific communities. Advocates for evidence-based medicine emphasize the importance of protecting individuals from potentially harmful and unproven treatments.\n\nThe controversy surrounding MMS underscores the importance of relying on evidence-based medical practices and the need for public awareness regarding potential health risks associated with unproven treatments. In addition, the popularity of MMS at one time as a remedy for autism should make us all weary of the power of zealous beliefs supported with religious fervor and no evidence.\n\n\n9.7.3 Caution:\n\nLack of Scientific Support: The endorsement of MMS as an autism treatment lacks scientific credibility. Rigorous clinical trials with proper controls and methodologies are absent, rendering any claims about its benefits for autism unproven.\nHealth Risks and Side Effects: MMS contains chlorine dioxide, an industrial chemical. Ingesting it can lead to severe health risks, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and potentially life-threatening complications. The Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the dangers of MMS consumption.\nEthical Concerns: Using MMS for autism raises ethical concerns, especially when targeting vulnerable populations like children with autism. Advocates for evidence-based medicine and ethical healthcare practices strongly caution against the use of unproven and potentially harmful substances.\nLegal Implications: Due to health risks, the sale and distribution of MMS as a medical treatment face legal challenges. Regulatory authorities take actions to prevent its promotion for therapeutic purposes, highlighting the potential harm to public health.\n\nIn conclusion, Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) lacks scientifically proven benefits for treating autism or any health condition. Its use is associated with significant health risks, and regulatory authorities strongly discourage its consumption. Individuals and families seeking interventions for autism are urged to prioritize evidence-based treatments and consult healthcare professionals for the well-being and safety of those with autism spectrum disorder.",

    "section": "9.8 Stem Cell Therapy",
    "text": "9.8 Stem Cell Therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nAs of 2022, the use of stem cell therapy as a treatment or cure for autism is prohibited in India. This restriction has been implemented due to misleading promotions and false claims. The only way to legally and ethically access stem cell therapy is to participate in an approved clinical trial.\n\n\n\n9.8.1 What are stem cells?\nStem cells are a group of cells that are present in our bodies through all stages of life. In fact, they are one of the first cells developed during the embryo stage. These cells, under the right environment, have the ability to generate new stem cells and also other cells with specialized functions (blood cells, brain cells, bone cells etc.) Because of this unique feature, stem cells play a key role in the development of newborn children and also in the restorative processes after a disease or an injury. Their ability to self-renew and multiply, ensures an ongoing source of new cells to replace old or injured ones. During the developmental years, this growth is vital for maturing into an adult. Once development is complete, this ongoing growth aids in healing and repairing damaged tissues or organs at a cellular level. These special characteristics make stem cells highly important in regenerative medicine, as they can create entire tissues and organs from just a small group of precursor cells.This characteristic of stem cells has kindled research interest in trying this as a treatment for various diseases.\n\n\n9.8.2 What is stem cell therapy?\nStem cell therapy, also known as regenerative medicine, aids in fixing damaged, malfunctioning, or injured tissues using stem cells or their byproducts. It marks a new phase in organ transplantation, utilizing cells rather than donor organs that are limited.\nIn laboratories, scientists cultivate stem cells under favorable conditions. These cells are modified to become specific cell types, like heart muscle, blood, or nerve cells. These specialized cells can be placed into a person’s body. For instance, if someone has a heart condition, these cells might be inserted into the heart muscle. The transplanted healthy heart muscle cells may assist in repairing the damaged heart muscle.\n\n\n9.8.3 History of stem cell therapy\nZoologists Theodor Heinrich Boveri and Valentin Häcker used the term stem cell to describe cells committed to give rise to the germline.\n\n1950s - scientists studied the potential of stem cells majorly through bone marrow and its role in generating various blood cells\n1956 - first successful bone marrow transplant was done. This procedure laid the foundation for using stem cells in medical treatments, especially in treating diseases like leukemia and other blood-related disorders.\n1981 - mouse embryonic stem cells was first cultured in the laboratory\n1988 - first umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant took place in a child with Fancoi’s anemia.\n1998 - scientists isolated and cultured human embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough enabled researchers to work with cells that had the potential to develop into almost any cell type in the human body. This discovery opened up new possibilities for regenerative medicine and treatment of a wide array of diseases and injuries.\n2006 - Discovered the technique of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), which involves transforming adult skin cells into cells that closely mimic human embryonic stem cells\nPresently, stem cell therapy is applied in various areas of medicine. For example, bone marrow transplants are used in the treatment of leukemia and other blood disorders. Stem cells are being researched and utilized for regenerative medicine to potentially treat conditions such as heart disease, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, and more. Clinical trials and research studies continue to explore the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for various health conditions.\n\n\n\n9.8.4 Why was it tried for autism?\nStem cell therapy has been considered as a potential treatment for autism due to the belief that it might target certain biological mechanisms or symptoms (immune system regulation and inflammation, neural connectivity, etc.) associated with the condition.\nReasons why stem cell therapy is being explored for autism include:\n\nRegenerative Potential: Stem cells possess the capability to transform into various cell types. The idea is that they might aid in repairing or regenerating damaged or dysfunctional cells in the brain or nervous system, potentially impacting autism-related symptoms.\nInflammation and Immune Modulation: Studies suggest that immune system dysregulation or inflammation might contribute to certain cases of autism. Some types of stem cells, particularly mesenchymal stem cells, have shown potential in regulating immune responses and reducing inflammation. Researchers hope that this immune-modulating ability might alleviate certain autism-related symptoms.\nNeuroprotective and Neurotrophic Effects: Stem cells produce substances that support the growth and survival of neurons. Researchers explore whether stem cells could protect existing neurons, encourage neuronal growth, and potentially enhance neural connections in individuals with autism.\nExperimental Nature of Treatment: While conventional treatments for autism primarily focus on behavioral and therapeutic interventions, stem cell therapy is considered experimental. It aims to address potential underlying biological factors that traditional therapies might not directly target.\n\nHowever, it’s essential to understand that while stem cell therapy has shown promise in various medical areas, its effectiveness and safety in treating autism are still being investigated. Clinical trials exploring the safety and potential efficacy of stem cell therapy for autism began in the early 2010s. These trials aimed to investigate the safety, feasibility, and any potential improvements in behavior, communication, and other symptoms associated with autism. It remains an experimental and unproven treatment for autism.\nThe scientific and medical community stress the necessity for further comprehensive research, including well-designed clinical trials, to determine its safety, efficacy, and long-term impact on individuals with autism.\n\n\n9.8.5 Caution\nStem cell therapy for Autism is still under investigation and there is no established finding of cure in using the treatment for autism. There are limited studies and no definitive results yet. Among the limited studies, the results cannot be generalized as all of the studies have a small sample size. Like any medical intervention, stem cell therapy also carries potential risks.\n\nUnintended side effects or complications could arise from the procedure, such as infection, immune rejection, or the formation of tumors.\nThe outcomes of stem cell therapy for autism can vary widely from person to person. It’s difficult to predict how an individual will respond to the treatment or if it will have any positive effects on their symptoms.\nIt involves invasive medical procedures and requires the individual to be admitted for at least 5 days. Furthermore, the treatment is hard on the pocket when done commercially.\nSome facilities offering stem cell treatments might not adhere to strict regulatory standards or might lack sufficient scientific evidence supporting their procedures. If any medical center is experimenting and an individual is part of a clinical trial, they should be treated free of cost.\nThere have been reports of adverse short-term effects associated with stem cell therapy, including aggressive behavior, nausea, vomiting, and seizures. Research on the long-term effects of stem cell therapy is still in its early stages, and a comprehensive understanding of its lasting impact is yet to be established.\n\n\n\n9.8.6 Current status in India\nStarting around 2010, stem cell therapy has been advertised as a potential cure for autism by many practitioners in India, despite no evidence for the same. Many parents have fallen victim to the unethical medical and business practice associated with stem cell treatment.\nAs of 2022, the use of stem cell therapy as a treatment or cure for autism is prohibited in India. This restriction has been implemented due to misleading promotions and false claims. Currently, stem cell therapy for conditions outlined in the National Guideline for Stem Cell Research (NGSCR) 2017, excluding Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)/ hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), is neither accessible nor permitted. Individuals can only participate in stem cell treatment through a clinical trial if they meet the specified criteria for the trial.\nIn this context, it’s important to highlight that there is currently no clinical evidence validating the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treating autism. Therefore, any facility claiming otherwise should be approached with caution and careful consideration. The National Medical Council (NMC) calls it professional misconduct when anybody practices, advertises, or promotes stem cell therapy as a treatment or cure for autism.\nGiven these factors, families considering stem cell therapy believing it will lead to significant improvements or a cure for autism need to seriously reconsider and make an informed decision. The only ethical and scientific way to get stem cell therapy is to participate in a well designed clinical trial or study. The path ahead demands a cautious approach to verify the safety, efficacy and long term impacts of the therapy.\nHere is a video created in 2023 by Yash Charitable Trust (YCT), and Forum for Autism, against the use of stem cell therapy as a treatment.",

    "section": "9.9 Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)",
    "text": "9.9 Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)\nIn hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), the individual enters a pressurized chamber where they inhale pure oxygen. Inside this chamber, the air pressure is double compared to the normal air we breathe outside. This treatment increases the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood, allowing it to reach the brain and other parts of the body.\nHBOT is based on the principle of delivering increased levels of oxygen to the body’s tissues by exposing individuals to pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber. The primary components are increased atmospheric pressure and elevated oxygen concentration. It enables increased oxygen supply to organs that lack sufficient oxygen. The oxygen is dissolved in the blood, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluids.The increased oxygen levels stimulate and accelerate bodily functions that rely on oxygen, from essential processes like heartbeats to cognitive functions and movements. Due to this, HBOT has shown promising potential in addressing or lessening symptoms related to cognitive and mobility decline. Studies have indicated that the combination of high oxygen levels (hyperoxia) and pressure in a hyperbaric environment can boost tissue oxygenation. It is believed that this manipulation affects oxygen and pressure-sensitive genes, ultimately leading to improved tissue metabolism.\n\n9.9.1 History of HBOT\nThe use of oxygen therapy goes back to 1662 when British physician Nathaniel Henshaw built the first pressurized room to treat pulmonary and digestive conditions. The basic principle behind Henshaw’s work was the notion that breathing in a pressurized environment could have positive effects on health. However, the understanding of the physiological effects of increased pressure and the therapeutic applications of hyperbaric environments was in its infancy then.\n\n1662: The concept of increased atmospheric pressure influencing the human body was first proposed by British clergyman and scientist Henshaw. He built a “Domicilium,” a sealed chamber, and suggested that it could be used to treat various medical conditions.\n1834: French surgeon Junod constructed a portable hyperbaric chamber and reported beneficial effects on patients with various conditions. The Bulletin of the Academy of Medicine reported Dr. Junod’s success with a complete recovery from a variety of medical conditions.\n1861: Paul Bert, a French physiologist, conducted comprehensive studies on the effects of increased atmospheric pressure and discovered the toxic effects of high-pressure oxygen that were manifested as seizures. He is known as the “father of hyperbaric physiology”\n1900s- Interest in oxygen therapy resurged when French doctors observed that patients undergoing hyperbaric-assisted surgery experienced fewer complications. Dr. John S. Haldane played an important role in advancing this field by studying the effects of compressed oxygen and subsequently developing dive tables for the Royal Navy. He came to be known as “Father of Oxygen Therapy.”\n1928- Dr.Cunningham discovered that there is a difference in mortality rate between flu patients living in higher elevations compared to patients living at lower elevations. In higher elevations, one breathes in less oxygen. He built a 5 storey chamber that offered more than 60 rooms designed to treat flu patients. In addition, Harvard Medical School built its first hyperbaric chamber,\n1937-1942: The U.S. military used hyperbaric oxygen to treat deep-sea divers with decompression sickness, also known as the bends.\n1955- Churchill-Davidson applied HBO to potentiate the effects of radiation therapy in cancer patients, while at the same time Boerema developed HBO as an adjunct to cardiac surgery, thus prolonging the time for circulatory arrest\n1956: The U.S. Navy established the first hyperbaric research program to explore various therapeutic applications.\n1960s: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy gained recognition for treating conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning, crush injuries, and non-healing wounds.\n1970s: Hyperbaric chambers became more widely available, and research expanded to explore the therapy’s potential in treating other conditions, including chronic non-healing wounds and certain infections.\n1980s: The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) was founded to promote research, education, and standards of practice in the field of hyperbaric medicine.\n1990s: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy gained popularity in treating chronic wounds, radiation injuries, and other conditions. However, there was controversy and debate about its efficacy in some applications.\n2000s: Research continued to explore the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for various neurological conditions, including traumatic brain injuries and certain neurodevelopmental disorders.\nPresent: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used as a standard treatment for conditions such as decompression sickness, chronic non-healing wounds, and certain infections. Ongoing research is exploring its potential applications in areas such as neurology, sports medicine, and chronic diseases.\n\n\n\n9.9.2 Why was HBOT used for autism?\nHBOT, given its principles, was believed to address the biological symptoms of autism such as immune system dysregulation and inflammation. It is still experimental and no regulatory body approves using HBOT as a treatment for autism. It was seen a as a potential treatment for autism due to:\n\nAnti-Inflammatory Effects: Some studies have proposed that inflammation might play a role in the development of certain cases of autism causing communication issues and behaviors. HBOT, having its anti-inflammatory properties, is believed by some to potentially reduce inflammation in the brain, contributing to improvements in symptoms.\nOxygenation and Neural Function: The therapy involves exposing individuals to increased levels of oxygen, which may enhance oxygenation of tissues, including the brain. This increased oxygen availability is thought to support neural function and promote overall brain health.\nNeuroprotection and Tissue Repair: HBOT is known for its role in promoting tissue repair and regeneration. Proponents of HBOT for autism suggest that the therapy might have neuroprotective effects and contribute to the repair of neural circuits, potentially improving certain aspects of neurological function in individuals with autism.\nBlood Flow and Oxygen Delivery: The increased atmospheric pressure in the hyperbaric chamber enhances the solubility of oxygen in the blood, leading to higher oxygen concentrations in tissues. This is believed to improve blood flow and oxygen delivery to areas of the brain that may be affected in individuals with autism.\nMitigation of Oxidative Stress: Oxidative stress, resulting from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants, has been implicated in some cases of autism. HBOT proponents believe that HBOT may have antioxidant effects, potentially mitigating oxidative stress and its impact on the brain.\n\nSimilar to other alternative treatments, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is categorized as an alternative treatment due to insufficient data, lack of conclusive evidence regarding its efficacy and impact. Comprehensive and definitive research is required before considering HBOT as a treatment for autism. Presently, studies suggesting its efficacy in treating autism are still experimental, and no definitive claims have been established. Therefore, like any alternative treatment, caution is advised when considering HBOT for autism.\n\n\n9.9.3 Caution\nWhile hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has demonstrated effectiveness for certain conditions like the flu and decompression sickness, its impact on individuals with autism remains unclear. Like any treatment, HBOT has associated side effects. Combined with the absence of conclusive evidence regarding its positive effects for autism, it is crucial to approach such treatments with caution and make informed decisions. Some reasons to exercise caution include:\n\nLack of Definitive Evidence: Scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of HBOT for autism is limited and inconclusive. The absence of well-designed, large-scale clinical trials makes it challenging to firmly establish the safety and effectiveness of HBOT for autism.\nHeterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Autism is a heterogeneous condition with a wide range of symptoms and underlying factors. Responses to HBOT can vary among individuals with ASD, making it difficult to predict outcomes or adopt a one-size-fits-all approach.\nRisk of Adverse Effects: While generally considered safe, HBOT is not without risks. Adverse effects, such as ear barotrauma and sinus discomfort, can occur. The potential long-term effects of prolonged or repeated HBOT sessions for individuals with autism are not well understood.\nMedical procedure and Financial Costs: HBOT requires a lot of sessions and can be expensive. It may also not be covered by health insurance for the treatment of autism due to its experimental nature. Families should carefully assess the financial implications and weigh potential benefits against costs.\nEthical Considerations: Offering HBOT for autism without conclusive evidence of efficacy raises ethical concerns. Families should be cautious about therapies making bold claims without robust scientific support.\nUnregulated Clinics and Non-Medical Settings: Some facilities offer HBOT for autism outside rigorous clinical trials, and standards of care may vary. Treatment in reputable healthcare institutions with experienced professionals ensures safety and monitoring.\n\nIn summary, caution is advised when considering HBOT for autism. Thoroughly understanding the current scientific evidence, potential risks, and the experimental nature of the treatment is essential. Consulting with healthcare professionals and participating in well-designed clinical trials, when available, can offer more guidance on the appropriateness of HBOT for individual cases.",

    "section": "9.10 Restrictive Diets",
    "text": "9.10 Restrictive Diets\nA diet is the combination and quantity of foods that an individual consumes. A healthy diet is one that provides all the necessary nutrients required for optimal well-being. Nutritional needs can vary based on factors such as geography, lifestyle, and health conditions. Therefore, individuals may benefit from diverse diets tailored to their specific requirements.\nOne common symptom of autism is restricted eating patterns, making individuals with autism more susceptible to certain dietary challenges. Some individuals with autism may experience heightened sensitivity to taste and food textures, similar to their sensitivity to light and touch. This sensitivity can influence the types and quantities of food they consume. However, it’s essential to note that the nutritional needs of individuals with autism are generally not significantly different from those of others in their age group. Therefore, exposing them to a healthy and varied diet is crucial for their overall development, unless there are specific allergies or intolerances to certain foods as some autistic individuals suffer from Gastrointestinal disturbances.\n\n9.10.1 Diet - Autism Connection\nThe concept of diets impacting various autistic symptoms is rooted in the understanding of the gut-brain connection. The physical and biochemical connection between these two organs involves several mechanisms:\n\nVagus Nerve: The vagus nerve, one of the largest nerves in the body, establishes a strong connection between the gut and the brain. It facilitates the bidirectional transmission of signals.\nNeurotransmitters: Chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters play a crucial role in connecting the gut and the brain. These neurotransmitters, which regulate emotions and feelings, are produced in the brain. For instance, serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with happiness and circadian rhythm control, is produced in both the brain and the gut. Additionally, gut microbes contribute to the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that helps manage feelings of fear and anxiety.\nGut Microbes: The trillions of microbes residing in the gut are integral to this connection. They produce various chemicals, including short-chain fatty acids that can reduce appetite and contribute to the formation of the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, these microbes play a role in immune system functioning, impacting inflammation. An overactive immune system can lead to inflammation, which, in turn, affects brain health.\n\nIn summary, the physical and biochemical interactions between the gut and brain involve the vagus nerve, neurotransmitters, and the activities of gut microbes. These connections influence emotional well-being, immune responses, and inflammation, contributing to the overall health of both the gut and the brain.\n\n\n9.10.2 History of diet as therapy\nThe use of diets as a treatment for various medical conditions has a long and diverse history, and different diets have been proposed and implemented for therapeutic purposes.\n\nAncient Civilizations: Ancient cultures recognized the influence of diet on health. Hippocrates, often referred to as the “Father of Medicine” in ancient Greece, emphasized the significance of diet in maintaining health and preventing disease.\nFasting in Ancient Religions: Fasting has been a practice in many ancient religions for spiritual and health-related reasons. It is believed to purify the body and mind.\nDiet in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda: Traditional Chinese Medicine and the traditional system of medicine in India, Ayurveda, incorporate dietary principles as essential components of holistic healthcare. These systems emphasize balancing energies within the body through proper nutrition.\nDiet in the Middle Ages: In medieval Europe, dietary practices were often influenced by religious beliefs. Fasting and abstaining from certain foods were common practices in the belief of purifying the body from toxins.\nVitamin Deficiency Diseases: In the 18th and 19th centuries, the recognition of deficiency diseases, such as scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) and rickets (vitamin D deficiency), led to the understanding of the role of specific nutrients in preventing and treating illnesses.\nDiets for Epilepsy: The ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, was introduced in the 1920s as a treatment for epilepsy. It fell out of favor with the advent of antiepileptic drugs but experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century.\nDietary Approaches for Specific Conditions: Over the years, various diets have been proposed and explored for specific health conditions. For example, the low-sodium DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet for managing hypertension and the Mediterranean diet for heart health gained recognition.\nDevelopment of Therapeutic Diets: Therapeutic diets, designed to manage specific health conditions, have been developed. These include the gluten-free diet for celiac disease, the low-FODMAP diet for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the low-phenylalanine diet for phenylketonuria (PKU).\nEmergence of Dietary Therapies for Neurodevelopmental Disorders: In recent years, specific dietary interventions, like the gluten-free, casein-free (GFCF) diet, have been investigated for conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dr. Karl Reichelt proposed a hypothesis in 1991, suggesting that the consumption of gluten and casein by individuals with celiac disease might contribute to autism, particularly in those predisposed to the condition. According to this theory, these proteins, in the presence of a “leaky gut,” could be absorbed, leading to the creation of peptides with opioid-like effects. These peptides, in turn, were theorized to mimic or induce autism. This hypothesis led to the development of the Gluten-Free and Casein-Free diet (GFCF), sparking considerable controversy.\nCurrent Trends: Today, there is growing interest in the role of diet in overall health and disease prevention. Diets like the ketogenic diet, paleolithic diet, and plant-based diets are popular, and research continues to explore their potential benefits.\n\nIt’s important to note that while dietary interventions can play a role in managing certain health conditions, the effectiveness of specific diets varies, and not all dietary approaches have robust scientific support. Individuals considering dietary changes for therapeutic purposes should consult with respective healthcare professionals to ensure that nutritional needs are met and that the chosen diet is appropriate for their specific health condition. It also helps to do some self-study from reliable resources to see if a specific dietary approach will be feasible for the autistic individual and the family.\n\n\n9.10.3 Types of diets for autism\nIn the light of gut brain connection, many diets have been suggested and tried as a treatment for various disorders including autistic symptoms. Diverse dietary interventions have been proposed for individuals with autism, yet it’s crucial to note that the scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of these diets is often limited and varied. Here are some diet types suggested for autism:\n\nGluten-Free, Casein-Free (GFCF) Diet: This involves removing gluten (found in wheat, barley, and rye) and casein (found in dairy) from the individual’s diet. Advocates claim potential improvements in behavior and social interactions. This is the most researched and commonly suggested intervention.\nSpecific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD): A restrictive diet eliminating complex carbohydrates, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. It permits specific easily digestible carbohydrates, aiming to positively impact gut health and alleviate autism-related symptoms.\nKetogenic Diet: A high-fat, low-carb diet used for epilepsy. Some reports suggest potential positive effects on behavior and cognitive function in individuals with autism. It has been suggested that epilepsy drives the development for ASD.\nLow-Oxalate Diet: Restricts foods high in oxalates, compounds found in some fruits, veggies, and nuts. Advocates claim it may alleviate sensory processing and gut-related symptoms in autism.\nLow-FODMAP Diet: Designed to reduce fermentable carbohydrates, potentially beneficial for individuals with autism and gastrointestinal issues, though more research is needed.\nOmega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation: While not a specific diet, some individuals with autism are recommended omega-3 supplements for potential benefits in cognitive function and behavior.\n\nApproaching these dietary interventions cautiously is crucial, given the often inconclusive evidence regarding their effectiveness for autism. Individual responses can vary, and restrictive diets may pose challenges in meeting nutritional needs.\n\n\n9.10.4 Caution\nIt’s essential to clearly understand why a dietary approach is chosen to manage autism symptoms and carefully assess associated costs. The relationship between autism and diet is an ongoing area of study, with existing research often lacking robust methodology, relying on anecdotal reports or personal experiences. The mechanism underlying the effectiveness of a diet for autism remains an unresolved research question, primarily based on the assumption that individuals with autism having an imbalanced gut microbiota contribute to their autism symptoms. Considering autism’s multifactorial nature, there is no evidence that only an imbalanced gut causes autism. Accepting an intervention solely based on authority or convenience should be avoided, especially if it compromises the health of the individual with autism. Each diet comes with its own benefits and costs. The side effects or consequences of following these diets can vary, and individual responses may differ. Here are some considerations:\n\nNutritional Deficiencies: Restrictive diets, especially those that eliminate entire food groups, may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies. For example, the GFCF diet excludes wheat and dairy, which are sources of essential nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and fiber. Studies have reported low bone mineral densities among individuals with autism who have excluded dairy from their diets. It’s important to ensure that nutritional needs are met through alternative food sources or supplements.\nFurther Gastrointestinal Distress: Dietary changes, particularly those involving the removal of certain foods, can sometimes lead to gastrointestinal distress. This may include changes in bowel habits, constipation, or diarrhea. It’s crucial to monitor and address any digestive issues that may arise.\nSocial and Practical Challenges: Following a specialized diet can present social and practical challenges. Individuals with autism may already have preferences or sensitivities to certain textures or flavors, and imposing further dietary restrictions may affect their willingness to eat or participate in social activities.\nEmotional Impact: Dietary interventions can have emotional implications, particularly for children or individuals who may find it challenging to adapt to changes in their eating habits. It’s important to consider the emotional well-being of individuals with autism when implementing dietary changes.\nFinancial Costs: Some specialized diets may involve increased costs due to the need for specific ingredients, supplements, or alternative food products. Studies suggest that gluten free products are a certain percentage more expensive than products with gluten and casein. Considering the longeveity of intervention, it would be a sustained expense. Families should be aware of the financial implications and plan accordingly.\nUnsubstantiated Claims and Lack of Evidence: Many of the suggested diets for autism are based on anecdotal evidence rather than robust scientific research. Following a diet without sufficient evidence of its effectiveness may lead to disappointment and frustration if the expected benefits are not realized.\nPotential for Nutritional Excess: In some cases, the emphasis on certain food groups or supplements in an attempt to address specific symptoms may lead to an imbalance and excess intake of certain nutrients. This can have its own set of health implications.\n\nConsulting healthcare professionals, including accredited dietitians and specialists in autism, and thoroughly assessing the feasibility of the chosen approach in the context of the child’s health and family circumstances is essential to ensure that the selected diet is safe and suitable for overall well-being. It is reiterated that there is no definitive evidence supporting the sole effectiveness of a diet for managing autism. In most studies, the change in behaviors post diet are reports from parents and there has been no objective measurement of the same.",

    "section": "9.11 Homeopathy",
    "text": "9.11 Homeopathy\nHomeopathy is a system of alternative medicine that was developed in the late 18th century by Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician. The central principle of homeopathy is the “law of similars,” which states that a substance that can cause symptoms in a healthy person can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person. This concept is often expressed by the Latin phrase “similia similibus curentur,” meaning “like cures like.” Homeopathic remedies are prepared through a process called potentization, which involves a series of dilutions and succussions (vigorous shaking). The idea is that this process enhances the therapeutic properties of the substance while minimizing its toxic effects. The remedies are crafted for individuals based on the information shared about lifestyle, medical history, and current symptoms. It is thus believed to have a personalized and holistic approach to treatment. Homeopathy relies on the principle of individualization, suggesting that treatments should be tailored to each person’s unique symptoms and constitution.\nHowever, this variability makes it challenging to conduct large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that meet rigorous scientific standards. Consequently, the lack of standardized protocols and the individualized nature of homeopathy make it difficult to establish its effectiveness across diverse populations. While homeopathy has its proponents, it’s essential to acknowledge that its efficacy is a subject of significant debate within the scientific and medical communities.\n\n9.11.1 History of homeopathy\nHomeopathy was founded by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), who obtained his medical degree in Erlangen in 1779. Despite struggling financially during his initial years as a physician, Hahnemann made a significant discovery that would shape his future. In an experiment, he began taking regular doses of cinchona, also known as ‘the bark’ or quinine. Remarkably, he experienced symptoms similar to those of intermittent fever (malaria) but in a milder form and without the characteristic rigors of the disease. This observation sparked a groundbreaking idea.\nIn 1796, Hahnemann published his findings in “Essay on a New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Drugs.” This was followed by his influential work, “The Organon of the Healing Art,” in 1810. These works laid out the fundamental principles of homeopathy, including the “law of similars” and the process of potentization, shaping the foundation of this alternative medical system. Despite initial financial struggles, Hahnemann’s contributions to homeopathy gained recognition and had a lasting impact on the field of alternative medicine. Here is a timeline of how homeopathy progressed:\n\n1796: Dissatisfied with the medical practices of his time, Samuel Hahnemann began experimenting with the use of substances to treat various illnesses. He first describes the Law of Similars (“Like cures like”). This principle suggests that a substance that can cause symptoms in a healthy person can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person.\nLate 18th Century: Hahnemann conducted a series of experiments on himself and others, ingesting small doses of substances to observe their effects. He systematically recorded the symptoms produced and proposed the use of highly diluted doses of substances to treat similar symptoms in patients.\n1810: Hahnemann published his foundational work, “Organon of the Healing Art,” outlining the principles and practices of homeopathy. The text underwent several editions, with the final edition, the sixth, published posthumously in 1921.\n1830s: Homeopathic schools and hospitals begin to open in the United States and Europe.\n1838: Repertory to the More Characteristic Symptoms of Materia Medica, a homeopathic reference, first appears in English.\n1842: Oliver Wendel Holmes Sr.—physician, critic of homeopathy and father of a Supreme Court justice—publishes the scathing “Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions.”\n1847: The American Medical Association is founded, offering a decidedly unfavorable view of homeopathy. Homeopathy faced criticism and challenges, particularly from proponents of conventional medicine.\n1885: Hahnemann Hospital opens as a homeopathic facility in Philadelphia.\nMid-1900s: Homeopathic schools dwindle and disappear. Hahnemann Hospital is sold to new owners, who switch to allopathic medicine but retain a homeopathic library and some elective courses. The Flexner Report in the early 20th century, which led to the reform of medical education in the United States, marginalized homeopathy in favor of allopathic medicine.\n1972: The Center for Education and Development of Clinical Homeopathy was founded with the goal of teaching practical, pragmatic homeopathy at campuses across the country, including one in Philadelphia. In the latter half of the 20th century, there was a resurgence of interest in alternative and complementary medicine, including homeopathy. Some individuals sought out homeopathic treatments as an alternative or complementary approach to conventional medicine.\nCurrent Status: Homeopathy is practiced in various parts of the world, and homeopathic remedies are available over the counter in many countries. However, its acceptance within the mainstream medical community varies, with skepticism regarding its scientific basis and efficacy. Homeopathy continues to be a subject of debate and controversy within the scientific and medical communities. Research on the efficacy of homeopathic treatments has yielded mixed results, and debates persist on issues such as the mechanisms of action and the significance of highly diluted substances.\n\n\n\n9.11.2 Why homeopathy for autism?\nThe multifaceted nature of autism has led to the exploration of various “cures” for the condition. The application of homeopathy to autism lacks a clear rationale. Considering homeopathy is often considered an alternative medicine, it is applied broadly across different conditions. The decision to try homeopathy for autism might stem from a dissatisfaction with the gradual outcomes of evidence-based management and a natural inclination to explore every possible way for improvement.\nAdvocates assert that homeopathy enhances behavioral symptoms associated with autism, including aggressiveness, sensory processing issues, language, speech, and communication. However, these claims rely solely on anecdotal evidence. There is a notable absence of valid scientific evidence explaining the mechanisms by which homeopathy works for some individuals and not for others. The lack of a robust scientific foundation raises questions about the reliability and generalizability of reported improvements associated with homeopathic treatments for autism.\nCertain homeopathic practitioners argue against the use of randomized controlled trials, stating that patient satisfaction should be the sole criterion for judging the effectiveness of homeopathy. However, when clinical trials and systematic reviews have been conducted, the outcomes remain uncertain. While a few studies suggested slight effectiveness, a majority indicated that homeopathy had no therapeutic effect. It’s important to note that many trials included in systematic reviews were deemed imperfect in terms of design, application, or sample size. This highlights the challenges in establishing conclusive evidence regarding the efficacy of homeopathy through rigorous scientific methods.\n\n\n9.11.3 The Process of homeopathy for autism\nHomeopathic treatment for autism follows a personalized approach rooted in the principles of homeopathy. The process involves the following steps:\n\nInitial consultation: A comprehensive discussion with the individual with autism or their caregivers to collect information on medical history, behavioral symptoms, sensory sensitivities, and emotional well-being.\nIndividualized assessment: A focus on understanding the unique expression of symptoms in each person, including their overall constitution, temperament, and responses to various stimuli.\nChoosing the homeopathic remedy: Choosing a homeopathic remedy that aligns with the individual’s symptoms and constitutional characteristics. These remedies are often highly diluted substances derived from plants, minerals, or animals.\nPotentization: Subjecting the chosen remedy to potentization, involving dilution and succussion (vigorous shaking) to enhance therapeutic properties while minimizing potential toxic effects. Administration of the remedy: Providing the homeopathic remedy in a highly diluted form, typically as small sugar pellets or liquid drops. The dosage and frequency are determined by the homeopath’s recommendations.\nFollow-Up consultations: Regular follow-up sessions to evaluate the individual’s response to the remedy and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. These consultations help monitor changes in symptoms and emotional well-being.\nMonitoring progress: Continuously assessing the person’s progress, considering changes in behavioral symptoms, sensory sensitivities, and communication skills relevant to autism. Adjustments to the homeopathic remedy may be made based on the individual’s response.\n\n\n\n9.11.4 Caution\nCaution should be exercised when contemplating homeopathy as a treatment for autism, given several compelling reasons, despite its popularity in certain alternative medicine circles. Here are key factors contributing to the need for caution:\n\nLack of Scientific Evidence: The foundational principles of homeopathy, such as the law of similars and the use of highly diluted substances, lack robust scientific backing. Studies on homeopathic treatments for autism are often limited, with small-scale research producing mixed and inconclusive results.\nPlacebo Effect: Perceived benefits from homeopathic treatments may be influenced by the placebo effect, where improvements result from the belief in treatment efficacy rather than the treatment itself. This can lead to subjective reports of improvement that may not be objectively measurable.\nIndividual Variability in Responses: Responses to homeopathic treatments vary widely among individuals, making it challenging to predict outcomes. This variability is compounded by the diverse nature of autism symptoms, complicating the assessment of treatment efficacy.\nRisk of Delaying or Avoiding Evidence-Based Interventions: Relying solely on homeopathy may lead to delays in accessing evidence-based interventions with demonstrated efficacy. Established components of effective autism management, such as early and intensive behavioral interventions, may be postponed.\nFinancial Costs: Homeopathic treatments, like other alternative therapies, may incur financial costs. Families should consider the potential financial burden, especially when these treatments lack robust scientific support.\nPotential for Harm: While homeopathic remedies are generally considered safe due to their highly diluted nature, harm may occur if individuals forego proven medical treatments in favor of homeopathy. Prioritizing interventions with a solid scientific basis is crucial.\nUnregulated Nature of Homeopathic Products: Homeopathic products may not undergo the same regulatory scrutiny as conventional medications. Variability in quality control and manufacturing consistency raises concerns about the reliability and safety of these products.\nEthical Considerations: The use of homeopathy for autism raises ethical considerations, especially when individuals or families are led to believe in the efficacy of a treatment lacking strong scientific support. Providing accurate and transparent information about the evidence base for any therapeutic approach is essential.\n\nIn summary, exercising caution is important when considering homeopathy for autism, considering the lack of scientific validation, the potential for the placebo effect, individual variability, the risk of delaying evidence-based interventions, financial costs, the potential for harm, and the unregulated nature of homeopathic products. Prioritizing evidence-based interventions and consulting with healthcare professionals ensures informed decisions regarding the management of autism spectrum disorder.",

    "section": "9.12 Ayurveda",
    "text": "9.12 Ayurveda\nAyurveda, an ancient natural system of medicine said to have originated in India over 3,000 years ago, derives its name from the Sanskrit words “ayur” (life) and “veda” (science or knowledge), translating to “knowledge of life”. Advocates of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), such as Ayurveda, subscribe to the belief that the world operates in a state of balance. According to this perspective, optimal health is achieved when living creatures are in harmony with the universe. Conversely, disruptions in this balance are thought to lead to illnesses. Ayurveda treatment approaches health by focusing on restoring this balance as a means of addressing and treating various health conditions. It advocates for specific lifestyle interventions and natural therapies to restore balance among the body, mind, spirit, and the environment.\nAccording to Ayurveda, every person is made of the five basic elements found in the universe: Air, water, fire, space and earth. Central to Ayurvedic medicine are concepts such as universal interconnectedness, the body’s constitution (prakriti), and life forces (doshas). Treatment goals aim to eliminate impurities, alleviate symptoms, enhance disease resistance, reduce stress, and promote harmony in life. Treatment in Ayurveda commences with an internal purification process, followed by a tailored diet, herbal remedies, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation. Ayurvedic practitioners extensively use herbs, plants, oils, and common spices in their treatments.\nIn India, Ayurveda holds the status of a recognized form of medical care, alongside conventional Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathic medicine, and homeopathic medicine. When utilized as a complementary therapy alongside standard conventional medical care, Ayurveda has demonstrated some positive effects. However, it’s crucial to note that many Ayurvedic materials have not undergone extensive research in both Western and Indian contexts. Some products used in Ayurvedic medicine may include herbs, metals, minerals, or other substances that could pose harm if used improperly or without the guidance of a trained practitioner. Therefore, caution and expert guidance are advised when considering Ayurvedic treatments.\n\n9.12.1 Ayurveda and Autism\nThe idea of using Ayurveda for autism is a relatively recent development and is part of the broader interest in alternative and complementary therapies for managing various health conditions. Ayurveda, as an ancient system of medicine, has a long history, but its application to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) gained attention in the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st century. There is limited scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of Ayurveda in improving autism symptoms. Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine, encompasses a holistic approach to health and well-being. While some proponents suggest that Ayurvedic practices may offer benefits for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it’s crucial to note that research in this area is limited. The scientific community remains cautious about making definitive claims regarding the effectiveness of Ayurveda for autism. Some individuals and families may explore Ayurveda as a complementary or alternative therapy for autism based on the following principles:\n\nHolistic Approach: Ayurveda takes a holistic approach, considering the interconnectedness of the mind, body, and spirit. The belief is that balancing these aspects can contribute to overall health and well-being.\nIndividualized Treatment: Ayurvedic treatments are often individualized based on a person’s unique constitution or dosha. The idea is that addressing specific imbalances in an individual’s constitution may promote health and alleviate symptoms.\nDietary and Lifestyle Recommendations: Ayurveda places significant emphasis on dietary and lifestyle practices. Recommendations may include specific dietary modifications, the use of herbal remedies, and the incorporation of practices such as meditation, yoga, and breathing exercises.\nStress Reduction: Stress reduction is considered essential in Ayurveda for maintaining balance and preventing disease. Practices that promote relaxation and reduce stress, such as meditation and yoga, may be recommended.\nHerbal Remedies: Ayurveda incorporates the use of herbal remedies, derived from plants and natural substances. Some herbal formulations in Ayurveda are believed to have properties that may support cognitive function and address symptoms associated with neurological conditions.\n\nIt’s crucial to highlight the need for rigorous scientific research to establish the safety and effectiveness of Ayurveda in the context of autism. While anecdotal reports and individual testimonials may suggest positive outcomes, these do not substitute for well-designed clinical trials with large sample sizes and rigorous methodologies.\nIf individuals or families are considering Ayurveda for autism, it is strongly advised to consult with healthcare professionals, particularly those with expertise in autism. Integrating Ayurveda into an overall care plan in collaboration with conventional evidence-based interventions is essential. Open communication with healthcare providers ensures that any therapeutic approach aligns with the best interests and well-being of individuals with autism.\n\n\n9.12.2 History of Ayurveda\nThe history of Ayurveda is deeply rooted in ancient Indian civilization, and its principles have been passed down through oral traditions and written texts. Its foundations are deeply rooted in the ancient schools of Hindu Philosophical teachings, specifically the Vaisheshika school and the school of logic known as Nyaya. Additionally, Ayurveda is closely connected to the manifestation framework, commonly recognized as Samkhya. It emerged during the same period when the schools of Nyaya and Vaisheshika were flourishing. Ayurveda is also said to have a divine origin, believed to come from the Hindu God Brahma, who is considered the creator of the universe. Before the establishment of philosophical schools, this holistic knowledge of healing was passed from Brahma to sages, who then shared it with their disciples and the general population through writings and spoken stories. They described the healing properties of herbs in poetic verses called “Shlokas.”\nAyurveda’s foundation lies in four important collections of knowledge called Vedas. The Rig Veda, the most famous among them, talks about 67 plants and 1028 Shlokas. The Atharva Veda and Yajur Veda mention 293 and 81 plants with medicinal uses, respectively. Ayurveda’s practice is deeply rooted in the insights gained from these ancient Vedas. Following is an overview of the history of Ayurveda:\n\nVedic Period (1500 BCE - 600 BCE): The earliest roots of Ayurveda can be traced back to the Vedic period in ancient India. The knowledge of Ayurveda is believed to be part of the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. The Rigveda, one of the Vedic texts, contains hymns related to healing and the use of medicinal plants.\nCompilation of Ayurvedic Texts (600 BCE - 200 CE): The foundational texts of Ayurveda, known as the “Samhitas,” were compiled during this period. The most significant among them are the Charaka Samhita, attributed to the sage Charaka (physician), and the Sushruta Samhita, attributed to the sage Sushruta (surgeon). These texts cover various aspects of health, disease, diagnosis, treatment, and surgical procedures.\nGolden Age of Ayurveda (200 CE - 1200 CE): During this period, Ayurveda flourished and became more organized. The works of influential scholars such as Vagbhata contributed to the development and systematization of Ayurvedic knowledge. The Ashtanga Hridaya, written by Vagbhata, is an important compendium that synthesized earlier Ayurvedic teachings.\nIslamic Influence (1200 CE - 1800 CE): With the advent of Islamic rule in India, Ayurveda faced challenges but continued to evolve. Some Ayurvedic texts were translated into Arabic, and Unani medicine, influenced by Ayurveda, emerged as a distinct medical tradition.\nColonial Period (17th Century Onward): The colonial period saw the arrival of European powers in India. The British East India Company established control, and Ayurveda faced challenges during this period. The British colonial authorities initially viewed Ayurveda with skepticism.\nRevival Efforts (Late 19th Century - 20th Century): The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed efforts to revive and institutionalize Ayurveda. Key figures such as Swami Dayananda Saraswati and Mahatma Gandhi emphasized the importance of traditional Indian systems of medicine, including Ayurveda.\nPost-Independence Era (1947 Onward): After India gained independence in 1947, there were renewed efforts to promote and modernize Ayurveda. The establishment of institutions, research centers, and government initiatives aimed at preserving and promoting Ayurvedic knowledge.\nGlobal Recognition and Integration (Late 20th Century Onward): In recent decades, there has been a growing global interest in Ayurveda. It has gained recognition as an alternative and complementary system of medicine worldwide. Ayurvedic practices, including herbal remedies, dietary recommendations, and lifestyle interventions, have found a place in integrative medicine approaches.\n\nToday, Ayurveda continues to be practiced in India and other parts of the world. It has influenced various alternative and complementary medicine practices and is recognized for its holistic approach to health and well-being. Despite its rich history, it’s important to note that scientific validation and standardization of Ayurvedic practices remain ongoing challenges.\n\n\n9.12.3 Caution\nWhile some individuals and families may consider exploring Ayurveda as a complementary or alternative therapy for autism, it’s important to approach it with caution and consider several factors. Here are some key points to keep in mind when seeking Ayurveda for autism:\n\nLimited Scientific Evidence: There is limited scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of Ayurveda specifically for autism. Rigorous research, including well-designed clinical trials, is needed to establish its safety and effectiveness.\nIndividual Variability in Responses: Responses to Ayurvedic treatments can vary among individuals. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex and heterogeneous condition, and what works for one person may not work for another. Factors such as the severity of symptoms and overall health can influence individual responses.\nIntegration with Conventional Care: Ayurvedic approaches should be viewed as complementary rather than a substitute for evidence-based interventions recommended by healthcare providers. It’s important to communicate openly with healthcare professionals, including those with expertise in autism, to ensure that Ayurveda is integrated into an overall care plan.\nSafety Considerations: While Ayurveda is generally considered safe when practiced by trained practitioners, it’s crucial to ensure that any herbal remedies or dietary recommendations align with the individual’s overall health. Consult with healthcare professionals, especially if the individual is on any medications or has pre-existing health conditions.\nConsultation with Qualified Practitioners: Seek Ayurvedic treatments from qualified practitioners who have training and experience in Ayurveda. Professional Ayurvedic practitioners may have certifications or qualifications from recognized institutions. Verify their credentials before starting any treatment.\nTransparency and Informed Consent: Practitioners should be transparent about the nature of Ayurvedic treatments, potential benefits, and possible risks. Informed consent is essential, and individuals or caregivers should be fully informed about what to expect from Ayurvedic interventions.\nMonitoring Progress: Regularly monitor the individual’s progress and communicate with healthcare providers. If any concerns or unexpected changes arise, it’s important to discuss them with both Ayurvedic practitioners and conventional healthcare professionals.\nFinancial Considerations: Consider the financial implications of Ayurvedic treatments, as some interventions may involve costs. Be aware of any potential financial burden and ensure that the chosen approach aligns with the overall budget for healthcare.\nCultural Sensitivity: Ayurveda is deeply rooted in Indian culture, and cultural sensitivity is important. Ensure that practitioners understand and respect the cultural context and preferences of the individuals and families seeking Ayurvedic care.\nOngoing Communication: Establish open and ongoing communication between Ayurvedic practitioners and other healthcare providers involved in the individual’s care. Collaboration can contribute to a more comprehensive and integrated approach.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that individual experiences with Ayurveda may vary, and what works for one person may not work for another. For individuals or families considering Ayurveda for autism, consulting healthcare professionals, especially those knowledgeable about autism, is strongly advised. Integrating Ayurveda into an overall care plan should be a collaborative effort with healthcare providers familiar with both Ayurvedic principles and conventional evidence-based approaches to autism. Open communication ensures that any therapeutic approach aligns with the best interests and well-being of individuals with autism.",

    "text": "10.1 What can School do?\nWhen considering schooling and education options for their children on the autism spectrum, parents often start with: “Can my child go to school?” Sometimes this question is also phrased as a need - “my child needs to go to school. How will he get an education otherwise?” This seemingly simple thought opens the doors on a variety of questions and concerns that parents often struggle with.\nThe short answer to “Can my child go to school?” is yes, but the more important question is, “Should they, and if so, under what conditions?” It is important to note that it is not just about academic abilities. Readiness for school depends upon a wider set of prerequisite skills—communication (verbal or non-verbal), the ability to self-regulate, engage in social or learning routines with support, and manage transitions and the unpredictability that comes with a group setting. If these skills are still developing, a better question to ask is, “Will school help my child build these skills or will it overwhelm them?”\nHowever, before addressing this question, it’s important to think about what schooling and education mean and how they are different. Education is the acquisition of knowledge through formal learning and instruction. In contrast, schooling pertains to obtaining an education within a formal school setup. This difference is important as it helps us move beyond mere attendance and focus on a comprehensive educational journey for children on the autism spectrum. While we are at a point to choose between the both, it is worthy to note that education is more important than schooling.\nRecognizing that traditional education systems may pose challenges for autistic children is important. Unlike neurotypical children, the learning experience for autistic children can be difficult within conventional educational frameworks. This realization sets the stage for reimagining education to better suit the unique needs of children with autism.\nIn this section, we address a few questions, concerns and thoughts relating to education and schooling for children on the spectrum. For the purposes of this section, the children we are talking about are 5-11 year olds.\nSchooling can ideally help the child in getting social exposure, opportunities for peer interaction, academic and cognitive stimulation and a structured environment for skill development. However, the child will be met with the advantages of going to a school only if they are supported, understood and included meaningfully. If a child is struggling to keep up with the demands, or facing social exclusion, the benefits of school may never materialize and it can cost the mental health of the child. Parents are often told or they believe that the child will learn from being around their peers by observing and imitating, which works wonders for many children, but the assumption may be flawed for children having challenges in imitation or understanding social cues. Autistic kids often lack imitation skills or they imitate without full understanding. They may copy speech or behavior, but may not comprehend the meaning or intent. As a parent, one has to examine and have clarity on:\nHere is an analogy to understand this better. Imagine you want to teach the child to swim. One can take two approaches to teaching swimming:\nNow, with the first approach, some may learn, while others may struggle and panic. Similarly, putting a completely inexperienced driver in the driving seat of a car in the middle of traffic and leaving them to “figure it out” on the road can turn out to be extremely dangerous and irresponsible of the trainer too.\nThrowing them in the deep end or leaving them to “figure it out” might be what we end up doing to an autistic child, when we place them in a classroom without ensuring they understand the environment, they have the skills to participate meaningfully and that they are safe, seen and supported. This is not teaching, it is more of hoping.\nThe downside of starting with a mainstream school without taking the child’s readiness into account can look like - struggle with meltdowns after school, identity confusion, anxiety, accepting bullying, etc. Autistic children are often expected to “fit in” with neurotypical norms, and many quickly learn to mask their difficulties or develop unhealthy coping behaviours in order to avoid being judged or excluded. These behaviours can be mistaken for successful adaptations but they are likely to take a toll on their mental health in the long run.",

    "section": "10.2 School Readiness",
    "text": "10.2 School Readiness\nReadiness for school is often equated to chronological age or cognitive abilities. But for an autistic child, it is not just about the ABCs and 123s. School readiness involves a broader functional set of skills which help them navigate and benefit out of a group environment - being able to engage, communicate and learn in a shared space. School readiness in the child can look like:\n\nBeing able to communicate their needs - communication doesn’t equate speech (Read more on speech vs. communication). Whether verbal or non-verbal, the child should have a reliable method of communication. It can be through speech or gestures or visuals or using assistive technology. It is important because it facilitates participation in class, seeking help and expressing discomfort, if any.\nBeing able to handle separation from the primary caregiver - the child should be able to stay away from the caregiver for a period of time without significant distress. This can be built gradually with support.\nAbility to self-regulate or co-regulate - A packed school day full of transitions can get overwhelming for autistic children. They should be able to use calming strategies or be open to receiving help from adults to navigate challenges like waiting, turn taking or emotional ups and downs\nAbility to participate in a group - The child should be ready or be gradually supported to be a part of a shared space, among peers and adults. Apart from social interaction, group readiness also means ability to follow group rules and routines, managing the noise and navigating the social dynamics.\nAbility to access the learning - learning could be through visuals or by observing or even a small group (1:3) support, but the child should be able to access the learning i.e be receptive to the learning. Learning can be social skills or academics or functional skills.\n\n\nPrerequisite skills - preschool and primary school\nPreschools are often the first structured social environment a child is exposed to. For an autistic kid, this requires careful planning. The focus here again should not be solely on age, but the readiness. Key prerequisite skills include:\n\nBasic communication - the child should have a functional way to express their needs\nSeparation tolerance - the child should be able to be away from the primary caregiver for a brief duration without extreme distress\nTolerance for group settings - the ability to stay in a space with others without distress or disruptive behaviors\nRegulation - being able to regulate emotions with support\nAwareness of and interest in peers- ability to show interest in others even if not interacting as much.\n\nAt the primary school level, the environment becomes more demanding. There is an expectation of sustained attention, task completion, and social cooperation.\n\nUnderstanding and following routines: the child should be able to follow structured daily routines with some predictability.\nAttention span: the ability to stay engaged in an activity for at least 10–15 minutes with adult support.\nInstruction comprehension: understanding simple one- or two-step instructions.\nEmotional regulation skills: cope with changes, handle sensory inputs, and seek help when distressed.\nAcademic foundations: Foundational academic skills have to be in place for a meaningful learning experience - recognition of letters, numbers, colors or at least emerging pre-academic skills.",

    "text": "10.3 What can education look like\nWithout the prerequisite skills, school can become a space of confusion and anxiety, hindering growth. However, readiness does not equate complete independence. Readiness includes components such as the capacity for the child to participate in a group with support, the presence of an environment that scaffolds their needs and a team that works collaboratively.\nTherefore, let the child lead the decision. The goal is not just school attendance. It also includes meaningful learning and development. Whether that happens in a classroom, in nature or at a kitchen table, the right path should fit your child’s current strengths, needs and comfort. The path need not be what is typical or expected.\nSo the relevant questions is - will my child be able to learn the skills I hope he/she will learn if they go to school. If yes, then it makes sense to look for a school environment that supports these goals. The child should be in a position to deal with the social and cognitive demands of going to a school. If not, our next question can be: is going to school the only way to learn these skills? To which the answer is a firm no. The alternatives include:\n\nMainstream school with support - shadow teachers or inclusive education aids, an Individualised Education Plan (IEP) driven integration with goals tailored to the child.\nSpecial Education Schools, where there is likely be focused attention and specialized curriculum to meet the needs of the child and an environment with reduced sensory overload.\nAlternate schools (Waldorff, Montessori etc) - schools that follow a different curriculum from the mainstream schools, it is more flexible with the sensory needs, mixed age groups and experiential learning.\nHomeschooling - parents or guardians take responsibility for the child’s learning outside of traditional school setting. It gives the space for specialised curriculum, targeted interventions and sensory accommodations. Socialization and peer interaction can be tailored to the child’s comfort level and interests. Parents can join hands with other neurodivergent families and create a homeschooling community including experts from the field. It requires a considerable amount of parent’s time and effort, but allows for complete customisation of the child’s education plan to suit their strengths, interests and challenges.\n\nThese alternatives can be temporary or long term based on the child’s evolving needs. These are not limiting opportunities, but ensures that the opportunities are appropriate, accessible and beneficial. School can be a wonderful place for growth, but only when the environment matches the child’s readiness and the learning process suits their way of processing the world. It is very important that the child is learning safely, authentically and with joy.",

    "text": "10.4 What should children learn at this age?\nAs parents find a suitable learning environment for the child, another related question is what should the child learn at this age. This can also be used to assess whether the environment chosen for the child is working or not. Here is a general understanding of the developmental goals during the early schooling (5-11 year olds) that is meaningful for the child’s growth.\nA learning environment is often seen as a place of learning to read, write and do math. While these are important, learning, especially at this young age, should include broader aspects for neurodivergent children. They need opportunities to learn how to relate to others, understand emotions, regulate oneself, build a sense of self and engage meaningfully with the world around them - growth across all developmental areas should be nurtured. Core developmental domains include:\n\nPhysical development - gross motor and fine motor skills, body awareness and co-ordination and self-care routines\nCognitive development - Problem solving and reasoning, exploration and curiosity, understanding cause and effect and foundational concepts - numbers, shapes, time, patterns, letters\nCommunication and language development - expressing needs, feelings and thoughts, listening and following instructions, building vocabulary and using functional language, understanding social language (greeting, turn taking etc)\nSocio-emotional learning - recognising and understanding emotions, developing empathy and perspective taking, forming relationships, regulating emotions, beginning to advocate for their needs\nExecutive functioning - Attention and focus, planning and task initiation, flexible thinking and impulse control\nFunctional life skills - asking for help, participating in routines, transitioning between tasks, time management, personal hygiene and grooming, cleaning, eating, expressing needs\nLeisure skills - activities that children engage in for fun, relaxation and creative expression - games/ sports, art and craft, music, dance etc.\nAcademically, pre-literacy (story listening, sound awareness, letter recognition), early numeracy (counting, comparing quantities, patterns), matching, sorting, categorizing and learning through play and experience\n\nEssentially, what matters is how a child learns more than what a child learns. A learning environment that honors play as a learning tool, especially for kids this age, promotes deep learning and engagement as play gives the opportunity for children to develop their problem solving, imagination and negotiation skills. Ultimately, the goal of early schooling should be to lay the foundation for a lifelong love of learning and connection.",

    "section": "10.5 How does a learning environment look like",
    "text": "10.5 How does a learning environment look like\nJust like the child is assessed for readiness, it is important to look for an environment that supports the child’s growth. The learning space should be more than just a place of instructions and accommodations. Finding the best fit can be overwhelming, but rather than worrying if the school will take the child, a more empowering question to ask is “Does the school/ environment have what it takes to support my child? Is the school or environment prepared to support my child?” For an autistic child, it should be a space where they are understood, accepted and meaningfully included in the learning process.The following are some basic factors to look for:\n\nNeurodiversity awareness - An environment that understands neurodiversity must go beyond surface-level accommodations. It must embrace the diversity of brain types and recognise that autistic thinking, feeling, and learning are different and not necessarily deficient. Ask questions like:\n\nIs neurodiversity a part of staff training or classroom conversations?\nAre behaviours interpreted through a strengths-based lens, instead of being problematized?\nAre children supported to self-advocate or express boundaries?\n\n\nA truly inclusive culture is likely to be visible in the language used around neurodivergence, the materials in the classroom, and the way the people in the environment approach neurodiversity.\n\nMeaningful inclusion - Inclusion in its real sense means that every child has access to learning, participation, and peer interaction in ways that work for them. Inclusion is not about just placing a child in the same room as everyone else and letting them be. Look for:\n\nTeachers who differentiate instructions and use visual, kinesthetic, or play-based strategies.\nFlexible seating, modified tasks, and support to participate in group routines, without forcing conformity.\nA culture where differences are normalised and not hidden or masked.\n\n\nInclusion does not mean expecting autistic children to imitate neurotypical peers at the cost of their own regulation or identity. It means adapting the environment so all children can learn and belong.\n\nResponse to sensory and emotional needs - Many autistic children have challenges with sensory processing, transitions and emotional regulation. The school should see them as needs to be met with appropriate strategies rather than as a problem to be fixed. Some relevant questions are:\n\nIs the environment flexible to sensory needs - are there quiet corners, or allowance of movement breaks?\nHow do teachers respond to emotional distress or shutdowns? Is co-regulation part of the approach? Are teachers equipped with calming strategies?\nAre transitions between activities paced with visual schedules or routines to support predictability?\n\n\nChildren shouldn’t be expected to “cope” on their own. A responsive environment anticipates needs and is ready to support them rather than reacting to behaviours.\n\nOngoing training for teachers and non-teaching staff - Inclusion without sensitisation is incomplete. In order to be inclusive, the environment requires prepared adults and a space that supports the child’s way of being. Teachers are the foundation of a child’s school experience and every school that admits autistic children must commit to ongoing training for its staff. This should ideally include:\n\nFostering an understanding of autism and neurodivergence beyond clinical labels.\nFamiliarity and fluency in communication strategies like AAC, visual schedules, or gestures.\nTraining in regulation techniques like co-regulation, sensory support, and flexible expectations.\nTraining for non-teaching staff as well - transport workers, helpers, and administrative staff, so the entire school ecosystem feels safe and inclusive.\n\n\nWithout proper training, autistic children are often misunderstood. Teachers, too, face stress and burnout when they’re not equipped to support neurodivergent students. Sensitisation is learning to recognise distress, respond with empathy, adapt communication, and create safe, inclusive spaces. It helps teachers understand children’s behaviour as a way of communication, replacing control with connection.\n\nCurriculum that goes beyond academics - Autistic children may have unique learning pathways. Academic skills are only one part of a child’s development. One has to know whether the school values, focuses and supports holistic growth, which can look like the curriculum focusing on and including:\n\nPhysical development: fine motor, gross motor, and self-care routines.\nCognitive skills: improving problem-solving, understanding cause-effect, memory, and attention.\nSocial-emotional learning: recognising emotions, building relationships, coping with change.\nFunctional life skills: following routines, managing transitions, using tools (e.g., cutlery, bags, visual schedules).\nLeisure skills: engaging in play, art, music, or other recreational activities that offer joy and regulation.\n\n\nA meaningful learning environment should support holistic development of the child, and not just the usual academic checklists.\nSome questions you can pose to the management to understand a learning environment that you are looking to place your child in are:\n\nWhat support systems are in place for neurodivergent learners?\nIs there any special educator or an inclusion expert on staff?\nHow are the teachers trained to support emotional and sensory regulation?\nCan the curriculum be adapted to meet my child’s learning pace and style?\nWhat is your approach to behaviour - do you use reward/punishment systems, or do you look at underlying needs?\nAre there spaces for downtime or sensory breaks?\nHow do you work with families to create individualised plans?\n\nHence, it is not just about the child being ready for a shared learning space, but also finding a learning space that is ready for your child.",

    "text": "10.6 Inclusion - What it is and What it is not\n“Inclusion is not a destination, but an approach.”\nInclusion is not about making autistic children less autistic. It does not operate from the belief that children will grow out of autism by being in an inclusive setup. It is also not just about the space - just because they are physically present in the space, does not mean a child is included. If they are physically present, but are not attended to emotionally or no facilitation of meaningful learning takes place, inclusion has failed in that space.\nInclusion is often misunderstood as including children with special needs in a regular classroom. It goes deep beyond that, creating an environment where all the children irrespective of their neurological profile, physical ability, pace of learning, socioeconomic background, and any other differences, have equal access to the learning process and the curriculum being provided in the environment. It requires a fundamental shift in the system to remove barriers and meet the diverse needs of the children. Inclusive systems value the unique contributions students of all backgrounds bring to the classroom and allow diverse groups to grow side by side, to the benefit of all.\nAn inclusive system is built on the belief that a diverse classroom enriches the learning experience. The classroom culture promotes belonging - where everyone feels accepted, understood and valued. It could also include adults from diverse backgrounds or neurological profiles. In practical terms, it means:\n\nTeachers are trained to work with children with various academic and other abilities\nThe system recognises different learning styles and paces as well as different ways of participating\nThe curriculum is flexible to adapt to different learners\nThere is time, space and energy built into the syste, to provide the required support - visuals, support teachers, sensory spaces, small group learning settings, extra academic support, emotional support etc. etc to help children access learning in a way that would work for them\nThe classroom culture promotes belonging - every child is participating, valued and accepted.\nThe environment reflects diversity among the adults who shape the learning environment, including teachers, aides, administrators, and support staff.\n\n“Inclusivity is actually maintained when all members of a group are able to participate in its activities, which means, provisions made are considerate of all members and not just those from specific groups or, with special abilities, disabilities, and/or needs.”\nIt’s about making school a place where they can grow, learn, be themselves and feel respected. When classrooms/ systems are designed with multiple needs in mind, they become more flexible, compassionate, and effective learning environments for every student.\n\nWhy is inclusion important?\nInclusion in education promotes equity, belonging and social change. It ensures all the children regardless of their abilities or learning styles, have meaningful learning experiences. For children who might have otherwise been excluded, inclusive systems provide a safe space for authentic expression allowing the child to thrive in his/her own terms.\nBeyond the individual, inclusion enriches the entire ecosystem. It challenges stereotypes, reduces stigma and fosters empathy and collaboration among children and educators. In doing so, it paves the way to create a more just and equitable society, where differences are valued and not just accommodated.",

    "text": "10.7 Supporting autism in the school\nNow that schools are being called upon to meaningfully include diverse children, the role of schools and teachers requires intention, preparation and commitment. How should the school approach and support the admission of an autistic kid into the environment?\nBefore admission, schools should consider:\n\nAssessment of readiness from both sides - just as a child’s readiness is essential, so is the school’s. Does the school have the capacity - resources, training, and flexibility to provide a meaningful learning experience for the child?\nHaving a trained professional on board - Is there a professional on staff who will work with teachers to individualize instruction, adapt materials, and support the child’s specific needs?\nFacility to involve shadow teachers or give one to one support - some children benefit greatly from a dedicated support person to navigate through the school routine. This person would ideally serve as a bridge between the child, teacher, and peers.\nClear criteria for admission - the criteria for admitting an autistic child should be clear and the school should ensure that adequate support is in place. If the school cannot support the child, the school should be honest with its limitations and if possible try building on the capacity to include the child\nAccommodations and flexibility - From sensory-friendly spaces and visual schedules to adapted assignments and adjusted expectations, schools must be ready to make accommodations not as exceptions, but as part of inclusive practice.\n\nOnce admitted, the school holds certain minimum responsibilities towards the learning journey of the child to make it meaningful and supportive:\n\nCurating an IEP - An IEP is a roadmap tailored to the child’s goals, strengths, challenges, and supports required. It should be created in collaboration with the family and revised regularly.\nRegular meeting with parents - Parents and caregivers are experts in their child’s needs. Their involvement in setting goals and reviewing progress is essential.\nSensitisation and training for staff - All teachers and staff should receive basic training in neurodiversity, sensory regulation, emotional support strategies, and inclusive classroom practices.\n\n\nSupport for the teachers\nAs a teacher, one can expect the following support to facilitate meaningful experience for an autistic child:\n\nTraining in Inclusive Practices: understanding autism, communication styles, sensory processing, and behavior from a needs-based lens is foundational.\nTeam Support: access to a special educator, therapist, or mentor with whom they can consult, plan, and troubleshoot. A collaborative team makes inclusion sustainable.\nClassroom adaptation: Inclusion often requires shifting the way a classroom works - incorporating visual supports, allowing movement breaks, using predictable routines, offering multiple ways to demonstrate learning, and being flexible with acceptable behaviors should be allowed.\nReasonable Workload: teachers cannot be expected to carry all the emotional and logistical responsibility alone. Schools should ensure that classrooms are not overcrowded, that support staff are available, and that expectations are realistic.\n\nBy investing in training, collaboration, and meaningful accommodations, schools can become spaces where autistic children are not just present, but are understood, supported, and empowered to learn in their own way.",

    "text": "10.9 Beyond One Path: Choosing the Right Learning Approach for Your Child\nRecognizing that learning is about more than academics (encompasses emotional, social, functional, and joyful growth), families naturally ask: What is the right educational setting for my child right now? Very often, this question is posed as a choice between early intervention and schooling. For many parents of neurodivergent children, especially between ages 4 and 8, this question can feel overwhelming. The encouraging truth is that there isn’t just one right answer. What matters most is choosing what helps your child thrive, not just survive.\n\nEarly Intervention Versus Schooling: How to Choose for Children Aged 4–6\nAs schools increasingly commit to meaningful inclusion, families of autistic children aged 4–6 often face a crucial decision: should they continue with early intervention services or transition their child into a formal school environment? This choice can feel overwhelming, but understanding the purpose and benefits of each approach can help guide families toward what is best for their child.\n\nWhat Is Early Intervention?\nEarly intervention refers to specialized therapies and supports—such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral interventions, and family training—delivered as early as possible, often starting at age two or three. These services are designed to address developmental delays and help children build foundational skills in daily living, communication, and social interaction - regulation, play, and connection; readiness for later learning - skills such as attention, regulation, interaction, and communication. If your child is still developing these, early intervention through therapists, play-based programs, or home support is often more beneficial than prematurely placing them in a structured academic setting. Research shows that starting integrated developmental and behavioral interventions as soon as autism is diagnosed or suspected can have major long-term positive effects. The early years are a period of rapid brain development, making intervention especially effective at this stage. Research consistently shows that children who receive early intervention are more likely to experience significant progress in language, cognitive, and adaptive skills, and in some cases, may see a reduction in autism symptoms over time.\n\n\nWhat Does (or should) Schooling Offer?\nFormal schooling, including preschool and kindergarten, introduces children to structured routines, group learning, and socialization with peers. Schools can provide Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), accommodations, and access to a team of professionals. For some children, this environment fosters academic readiness, independence, and social growth. When schools are prepared with trained staff, sensory-friendly spaces, and the flexibility to adapt teaching methods, autistic children can thrive and participate meaningfully alongside their peers, provided the child is school ready.\n\n\n\nHow to Decide: Key Considerations\nChild’s Individual Needs and Readiness - If your child is still developing basic communication, social, or self-help skills, early intervention may be the most appropriate focus. These services are highly individualized and often involve parents as partners in therapy. If your child is showing readiness for group activities, can follow simple routines, and benefits from peer interaction, school may be a positive next step, especially if the school is equipped to provide the necessary support.\nSchool’s Capacity and Support - Before enrollment, assess whether the school has trained professionals, the ability to individualize instruction, and a willingness to provide accommodations. If the school cannot offer adequate support, it may be best to continue with early intervention while working with the school to build capacity for future inclusion.\nBlending Both Approaches - For many families, a combination works best. Children might attend school for part of the day and receive therapies outside of school hours. This blended approach allows for continued skill-building through intervention while benefiting from the social and academic experiences that school provides.\nAs parents make these decisions, they can sonsult with developmental pediatricians, therapists, and educators. Comprehensive evaluations can help determine whether your child is ready for school or would benefit from continued early intervention.\n\n\nNeed not be mutually exclusive\nEarly intervention and schooling are not mutually exclusive; the right choice depends on your child’s current developmental stage and the quality of available support at school. Early intervention is critical for building foundational skills and can have lasting positive effects, especially when started as soon as autism is diagnosed or suspected. Schooling offers opportunities for socialization and academic growth, but only if the child is ready and the environment is prepared and supportive. Many families find a gradual transition, or a combination of both, helps their child reach their fullest potential.\nUltimately, the decision should be guided by your child’s unique needs, the readiness and resources of the school, and ongoing input from professionals and your family. Starting early, staying flexible, and advocating for the right support will give your child the best chance to thrive.",

    "section": "10.10 Pushing children through mainstream school",
    "text": "10.10 Pushing children through mainstream school\nInclusion in mainstream schools is a right, but meaningful inclusion requires more than simply placing neurodivergent children—autistic, ADHD, or otherwise—into classrooms and hoping they will cope. Too often, children who appear quiet, compliant, or academically able are left to “manage” in environments that are not prepared or willing to meet their needs. When we ignore the nuanced support these children require and push them through the system because they seem to be coping, the consequences are profound and long-lasting.\n\nInitial Challenges: The Invisible Struggle\nMany autistic children who are kept in mainstream classrooms are there not because they are thriving, but because they are not disruptive. Their quietness is mistaken for adjustment, but in reality, it often reflects withdrawal and disengagement. These children can become almost invisible—present in body but not in spirit or participation. Their relationships with teachers and peers may be minimal or non-existent, and they are often left to navigate the day with little meaningful interaction. When they come to therapy, it becomes clear how much they have regressed—skills they once had fade, and even basic communication can become a struggle. The classroom often expects little of them, and so they get away with giving the bare minimum effort, reinforcing a cycle of passivity and isolation.\n\n\nEmotional and Social Fallout\nEven for those who manage to keep up with academics and avoid behavioral concerns, the emotional toll is significant. Mainstream settings, without adequate support, rarely address the emotional regulation needs of autistic students. Social nuances and feedback from peers and teachers become a confusing maze, and without guidance, these misunderstandings accumulate. The result is often emotional overload: sudden outbursts, meltdowns, or shutdowns, sometimes surfacing in school, sometimes saved for therapy or home. The pain of not being understood, of feeling different but unable to express it, can linger for years. Many autistic children and young adults recount experiences of bullying, exclusion, and invalidation in mainstream schools, leading to anxiety, depression, and a fractured sense of self.\n\n\nCognitive Gaps and the Illusion of Progress\nAcademically “bright” children in primary school may still develop significant gaps in understanding as they progress. Autistic students often excel at pattern recognition, rote learning, and multiple-choice tests, but these strengths can mask deeper difficulties with abstraction and concept formation. As the curriculum becomes more abstract in middle and high school, these gaps widen. Extra tuition and relentless academic focus do little to address the underlying issues; instead, learning becomes mechanical and disconnected from real understanding. The child may pass exams, but the knowledge is superficial, and the process of learning loses meaning.\n\n\nLife Skills and Independence: The Forgotten Curriculum\nWhen the focus is solely on academic achievement, essential life skills are neglected. Planning, organizing, self-care, and independent decision-making fall by the wayside. By the time these students finish school, many cannot manage basic daily tasks or initiate activities on their own. Parents, in their anxiety to ensure academic success, often continue to micromanage, unintentionally impairing independence. The result is young adults who may know how to cook or organize in theory but never take initiative, remaining passive observers in their own lives.\n\n\nLong-Term Consequences: Case Reflections\nThe stories of young adults who were pushed through mainstream school without adequate support are sobering. One young man with ADHD, after years of bottling up stress, experienced a complete breakdown and refused to continue his education. Another, a bright autistic adult, passed exams but never developed the social or emotional skills needed for adult life, struggling with unemployment, isolation, and emotional dysregulation. Both cases highlight how academic success, in the absence of holistic support, can leave neurodivergent individuals unprepared for life beyond school—emotionally, socially, and practically.\n\n\nThe Cost of Invalidation and Missed Communication\nMainstream schooling, when not thoughtfully adapted, often prioritizes compliance and correctness over acceptance and genuine connection. Casual conversation—the foundation of social bonds and self-expression—is rarely nurtured, leading to a “deficit of conversation” that follows autistic individuals into adulthood. When children cannot communicate their discomfort or needs, they experience deep invalidation and distress. Parents, fearing non-compliance, may become overprotective, further limiting opportunities for independence and self-advocacy.\n\n\nA Call for Meaningful Engagement\nThe lesson is clear: simply expecting children to “do it quietly” or fit in is not the answer. True inclusion means going beyond visible problems and academic performance to foster emotional regulation, communication, and self-worth. It means creating environments where neurodivergent children are not just present, but genuinely understood, valued, and supported to develop all aspects of their identity and not just their test scores.",

    "text": "10.11 Homeschooling as an option\nHomeschooling is increasingly considered by families of autistic children who seek a more individualized, supportive, and flexible approach to education. For some families, homeschooling is not a last resort, but a thoughtful, empowering choice. However, the decision to homeschool brings up important questions, apprehensions, and practical considerations. Common Apprehensions and Challenges include:\n\nSocialization: One of the major concerns could be that homeschooled children may have fewer opportunities to interact with peers, potentially impacting their social skills. This requires parents to be proactive in seeking out social opportunities through groups, clubs, or community events\nParental Commitment: Homeschooling demands significant time, energy, and organizational skills from parents. Not all families have the flexibility or resources to dedicate themselves to full-time teaching and therapy integration\nNeed for Expertise: Parents may feel unprepared to teach certain subjects or address specific learning needs. Accessing professional guidance, training, and support networks is crucial to overcome this challenge\nPotential for Isolation: Both the child and the parent can experience isolation if not connected with broader homeschooling or autism support communities.\n\n\nWhat is homeschooling and why might it be the better option?\nHomeschooling is not just replicating the structure of traditional school at home. Instead, it is an educational approach that can be highly personalized to a child’s strengths, interests, and needs. For autistic children, this often means adapting the pace, content, and environment to reduce stressors and maximize engagement. It can involve creative, real-world learning, integration of therapies, and flexibility in daily routines, rather than rigid adherence to a standard curriculum. It can be a better option because:\n\nTailored Learning: Homeschooling allows parents to customize academic goals, lessons, teaching methods, and schedules to fit the child’s unique learning style and pace. This can be especially valuable for autistic children, whose needs may not be completely met in a mainstream classroom\nReduced Sensory Overload: The environment can be better controlled to minimize sensory triggers, such as noise and bright lights, which are common in traditional schools and can be distressing for autistic children\nIntegrated Therapies: Parents can seamlessly incorporate speech, occupational, or behavioral therapies into the daily routine, ensuring that therapeutic goals are consistently addressed alongside academic learning\nSafety and Comfort: Homeschooling provides a relatively safe space free from bullying, exclusion, or misunderstanding, allowing children to learn and express themselves without fear of judgement\nFlexible Socialization: While socialization is different from school, families can arrange playdates, group activities, and community outings that are positive and manageable for them and their child, rather than overwhelming.\n\nHowever, there are some prerequisites to be fulfilled for effective homeschooling:\n\nTime and Commitment: At least one adult should have the ability to dedicate consistent time to planning, teaching, and supporting the child’s learning and development\nWillingness to Learn: Parents must be open to learning about autism, teaching strategies, and curriculum adaptation, and to seeking help when needed\nAccess to Resources: This includes curriculum materials, therapy providers, online learning platforms, and local homeschooling groups for support and guidance\nStructured, Supportive Environment: The home should offer a calm, organized space with routines that help the child feel secure and ready to learn.\n\n\n\nGetting Help from Outside\nFor families considering or undertaking homeschooling, connecting with supportive communities and specialized programs can make a world of difference. There are spaces from where a family with an autistic child can seek help wherein they can receive professional support from experts - therapists, educators who can provide interventions and specialized instruction or therapy sessions; build a network with fellow families and form a community and share resources. Here are two examples of organizations we run, that offer structured, community-based support for neurodivergent children and their families:\nAt Subodha, we are a close-knit community of parents, therapists, and educators working together to empower families. We believe in supporting parents to become active partners in their child’s learning and development. Family Training Program (FTP): We run an intensive three-month program where parents and children come together daily for half-day sessions. This immersive experience strengthens the parent-child bond and equips families with practical skills to support their child’s growth and learning at home. It also helps families decide if they want to continue with Subodha’s community-based programs.\n\nHomeschool Groups: For families who want to homeschool but seek guidance and structure, we facilitate small groups of parents and children. Our senior therapists and educators collaborate with parents to design individualized learning plans tailored to each child’s needs. We provide ongoing support for day-to-day teaching, creating a flexible yet structured environment that blends the best of home and school.\nAfterschool and Intensive Support: We offer after-school sessions focusing on academics, social skills, and daily living, as well as half-day intensive programs for children needing one-on-one support. These options can complement homeschooling or support children attending mainstream schools.\n\nAt Farmhill learning community, we are a neurodiverse, close-to-nature learning community where autistic and neurotypical children learn side by side, supported and respected for who they are.\n\nInclusive Philosophy: We believe education should adapt to the child, not the other way around. Our approach honors neurodiversity and focuses on building understanding, confidence, and joy in learning.\nCommunity and Continuity: Farm Hill is not just a school; it’s a community where families, teachers, therapists, and children live and learn together. This continuity allows us to provide consistent, holistic support that integrates education, therapy, and family life.\nRooted in Experience: Our founders, Venu and Chitra, started this journey after their own experiences navigating autism and education. Their vision guides us to create spaces where children are not forced to fit a mold but are empowered to grow authentically.\n\n\nSupport for Homeschooling famlies at Subodha and Farmhill\n\nWe provide professional guidance through our team of therapists and educators who help parents craft and adapt individualized learning plans.\nWe foster a community connection, so families don’t feel isolated but instead share experiences, resources, and encouragement.\nWe offer flexible support options—from full-time homeschooling groups to afterschool enrichment and therapy—that can be tailored to each family’s needs and schedules.\nBy working closely with families, we help create learning journeys that are meaningful, sustainable, and centered on the child’s unique strengths and challenges.",

    "text": "10.12 a mix of approaches\nLast but not the least, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking in absolutes: school versus homeschooling, therapy versus academics, mainstream versus special education, but real-life experiences and research show that the most effective support often comes from blending different approaches, adapting as the child grows and circumstances change.\nEvery autistic child is unique. Their strengths, challenges, and preferences can shift over time and also the family’s state of affairs. What works brilliantly one year may need adjustment the next. Rather than forcing a child into a single educational model, families and educators are encouraged to remain flexible, open-minded, and creative in finding what works best for the child and the family at any given moment.\n\nBlending Approaches: What Does It Look Like?\n\nCombining School and Therapy: Many children attend school part-time and receive therapies (speech, occupational, behavioral) outside of school hours. This ensures academic progress while continuing to build foundational skills.\nIntegrating Home and Community Learning: Homeschooling families often supplement with community classes, playgroups, or therapy sessions, creating a rich, varied learning environment.\nUsing Multi-Sensory and Cross-Disciplinary Methods: Schools and families can incorporate multi-sensory activities—engaging sight, sound, touch, and movement—to enhance learning and participation. Cross-disciplinary teams, including teachers, therapists, and parents, collaborate to support the child holistically.\nFlexible Socialization: Social skills can be developed in many settings—school, therapy groups, community activities, or even online. The key is to find environments where the child feels safe and motivated to connect with others.\n\nIt’s perfectly normal to try different options and make changes as needed. Some families start with early intervention, move to mainstream school, then shift to homeschooling for a period, and later reintegrate into group settings. The goal is not to “pick the right path” once and for all, but to respond thoughtfully to the child’s evolving needs and circumstances.\nNo matter the mix, success depends on strong communication between families, educators, and professionals. Regularly reviewing what’s working and what isn’t ensures that support remains relevant and effective. Involving the child in these conversations, when possible, can also empower them and respect their preferences.",

By moving beyond binaries and embracing a mix of approaches, we give every child the best chance to thrive, learn, and find joy in their unique journey.",

Children and parents seem to have completely different opinions about pretty much every aspect of food - what to eat, when to eat and how to eat.\nEating more than what we need, ‘indulging’, seems to be becoming a cultural norm. It does not help that more and more junk food is being engineered to create cravings. “No one can eat just one” is not a cute advertisement tagline any more, it is starting to sound more and more like a warning on an addictive substance!\nAt the same time, issues like picky eating, eating in a hurry, refusing to chew, not being able to maintain oral hygiene are on the rise. These issues become much more pronounced and difficult to handle with neurodiverse children, whose sensitivities and anxieties are as such difficult to live with.\nAs parents, our goal should be to help children eat good food in reasonable quantities at a sustained pace. In this article, we present a few thoughts and hands-on techniques to help neurodiverse children acquire and maintain good food habits.",

Most of our children love food, they are fully attentive and engaged around it, and it is difficult to think how that love is impacting them. However, our love should empower them, make them healthy and independent.\nEating is a part of lifestyle. Also, modelling is very powerful. So, any change we expect in the food habits of the child has to be implemented by the entire family.\nThe family should have a good routine for waking up and getting physical activity in the morning. It is important to drink water to stimulate bowel movement and build a sense of hunger. This is especially important for pooreaters.\nIt is important to plan balanced meals. Have a weekly meeting to plan the menu. Make space for favourite foods like samosas, popcorn or chicken burgers. Decide on the quantities. Even if your child is not verbal, make them a part of the meeting and let them respond with yes or no. All this activity builds predictability and reduces anxiety about favourite foods. You can use the menu as an opportunity to build communication, create a sense of time through the calendar, build it into their weekly #schedule, help them get into the habit of checking written instructions or schedules instead of asking the same questions again and again…the possibilities are endless! Remember our children love food and it is a great motivator.\nLast but not least, eat together as a family as frequently as you can. Show how to eat measured quantities of food. Talk about food and how you enjoy good food. Model to children that one can eat good, healthy food in moderate quantities and still be happy!",

Children eat because food calms them down, it provides actual psychological comfort! Most neurodiverse children also do not have well developed interoception that tells them when they are full. Sometimes, food not being available makes them upset and aggressive.\nWhile food calms them down, overeating affects health negatively. It is necessary to address this.\nFood and eating is a lifestyle issue. The entire family has to follow, model and reinforce the behaviour we expect of them. Working together and supporting each other is important.\n\nMake a weekly menu plan together. Include favourite as well as not favourite foods. The menu gives visibility of when favourite food is scheduled and helps prepare oneself for the not so favourite food. Remember to accommodate fancy food items and some junk food so there is no sense of deprivation.\nThe menu should cover all meals - midmorning snack, evening tea etc. If it is not on the menu, you do not eat it.\nAgree on measurements - we will have one samosa each; or one bowl of popcorn. Do not prepare or buy more than that.\nOn a daily basis, for every meal, everyone gets into the habit of measuring and eating - two rotis, one bowl of biryani etc. This shows them that everyone is following the same rules.\nRemember it is okay to say - “you have eaten your share. We can have this again - in the evening/tomorrow/next week” - as per your menu.\n\nTalk together, plan, do it together - modelling is very important.\nTake help of your therapists to handle any behaviours around food. Also, start when the children are young, it helps them get into good routines and helps everyone!",

    "text": "13.4 When children eat too little\nSome neurodiverse children eat very little food. It becomes a medical concern as the child’s immunity becomes low, they fall ill frequently, cannot play or move as they want to or like to, get irritated quickly which results in overall unhappiness and many behavioural issues. An unhappy child finds it difficult to learn or relate positively to learning.\nAgain, let us remember that eating is a lifestyle issue. While there are specific interventions to help with eating too little, interventions work well when the right environment and attitudes are in place. It is important for the entire family to follow, model and reinforce the behaviour we expect of the children. Working together and supporting each other is important.\nHowever, please eliminate any medical issues like dental sensitivities, stomach ailments etc. before trying the following interventions. Also, address any sensory sensitivities.\n\n13.4.1 Setting up the environment and attitude\nThe family should have a good routine for waking up and getting physical activity in the morning. It is important to drink water to stimulate bowel movement and build a sense of hunger. This is especially important for #pooreaters.\nHaving access to food throughout the day does not help with building an appetite. Food should be available at fixed time intervals that are part of a schedule. Even if a child ate poorly at breakfast, giving them a large glass of milk as a mid-morning snack may not be a good idea, as it interferes with the next meal.\nRelying on children’s hunger and letting them starve if they do not eat also does not help build good eating habits. Again, most neurodiverse children have poor interoception - they may not understand the relationship between eating, feeling full and that satisfaction leading to good quality time. If we let them starve, they may end up getting accustomed to staying hungry.\nReading books about food, learning about different kinds of food and tastes, communicating ‘I like’ and ‘I don’t like’ for foods, cooking and baking, talking about feelings while having these conversations can help in building food positivity in children.\nHere is a video sample of a social story about a boy eating lunch, that can help a child get comfortable around eating.\n\nAll members of the family eating together as frequently as you can is important. While you eat together, talk about food and how you enjoy good food. Model to children that one can safely try new food, it is okay to try and that sometimes you may end up liking new food too!\n\n\n13.4.2 Intervention for quantity\n\nNotice how much food the child is able to eat, at the beginning. This is the baseline for how much the child needs to eat. Measure this in spoonfuls, bites or mouthfuls.\nMake a visual schedule for the previously decided measure and the child ticks each box as they finish each measure. We can also use tokens that the child can remove for the countdown. This helps the child track how much they have eaten and how much more is left. Predictability helps manage anxiety.\n\nHere is a video that shows a child using tokens to eat a minimum quantity.\n\n\nOnce the child gets comfortable eating that portion for a few days, gradually increase the measure over a number of days. Decide the pace of increment carefully so we do not overwhelm the child with suddenly increasing demands.\nClearly inform the child whenever demand is increased.\nWith some children, preparing them with a social story helps. Writing a menu together and discussions about food also help the child to prepare himself to eat.\n\n\n\n13.4.3 Increasing variety\nOnce the child becomes comfortable with the schedule of eating, introduce one new food every three days, just one spoonful - preparing by writing a schedule and social story. Slowly, new foods became staple foods.",

    "section": "13.5 Pace of eating",
    "text": "13.5 Pace of eating\nThe other common issue with neurodiverse children is that they eat either too fast or too slow. Some finish an entire meal in 5 minutes; some take up to 2 hours to eat a snack.\nTypically, in either case, the child does not chew properly and it affects digestion. The quick eaters usually eat quite a lot of food before their hunger and palate are satisfied. This leads to weight gain and associated negative loops. The slow eaters tend to pocket the food in the mouth - this affects their oral hygiene. Also, the food tastes bland after being in the mouth for a long time and they lose interest.\n\n13.5.1 Intervention for the quick eaters\nThe key is to create some delay between one mouthful and the next, encouraging them to eat slowly and chew properly.\n\nthe child has a smiley chart and a bowl of smileys. The chart is a laminated sheet with velcro afixed on it. Smileys also have velcro fixed at the back. Pictures are below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the child takes one spoonful of food into the mouth, they fix the smileys from the bowl, on the chart. During this time, they keep chewing and the rule is they cannot take another mouthful till all the smileys are fixed. The chart with all smileys fixed looks like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all smileys are fixed, they take another spoonful of food.\nThis time, they pick the smileys from the chart and put them in the bowl.\nKeep doing this till the food is finished.\n\nHere is a video showing a child using a smiley chart to maintain a delay between mouthfuls.\n\nOnce, we came across a child who would touch food and everything around with both hands. Smiley chart would have been unhygienic. We modified the intervention.\n\nA table mat, with spaces drawn for the child’s plate, glass and hands was created. The child was expected to keep the plate and glass on the mat, as well as keep their hands on the spaces indicated on the mat. The mat can look like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number line with numbers 1 to 10 was also drawn on the top of the mat.\nThe child takes a spoonful of food, and uses fingers to count from one to ten on the numberline. They chew while doing this.\nOnce the numbers are counted, they can take the next spoonful.\nThe mat structure helped the child keep their hands clean while eating, as well as introducing delay between spoonfuls through counting.\n\nHere is a video showing a child using a mat like that to maintain a healthy pace of eating.\n\nIn both the above cases, the children were older than ten. All the prompts used to remind them to follow the sequence were either written or pictorial so there was not much verbal input, repeated instructions or anyone losing temper.\n\n\n13.5.2 Intervention for the slow eaters\nWith slow eaters, the key is to create a limit on the time the child keeps food in the mouth. To do this, we mark the beginning and ending of each mouthful so the child has a cue for when the food should be swallowed. We also need to help the child keep track of how much they should eat and how much they have eaten. For this, we use checkboxes or tokens.\n\nEstablish the average quantity the child can comfortably eat. Measure this in bites, spoonfuls or mouthfuls.\nMake a visual schedule for the number of measures to be eaten. We provide tick boxes or tokens for each measure. For example, if the child has to eat 15 spoonfuls, we make 15 checkboxes or give 15 tokens.\nThe child takes food in the mouth. We start counting from 1 to 10, in a calm voice, to encourage the child to continue chewing. We can also draw a number line and progress on it if we want to avoid verbal input. This tells the child that they have to finish the mouthful within this count.\nAt the end of the count, the child ticks a box or counts down by removing a token.\nWe can plan a break for every 3 or 5 measures, so the child can pause and does not get overwhelmed.\nThe intervention ends when the food is finished!",

    "text": "15.1 Preventive Dental care\nDental care is a difficult to deal with aspect of autism, as it relates to many sensory triggers that people on the spectrum experience. In the presence of oral sensitivities, children find it difficult to open mouth, allow a brush inside, use appropriate pressure to brush etc. The resulting lack of oral hygiene causes issues starting from gum infections to dental carries, causes pain, restricts eating, and negatively impacts the overall health of individuals on the spectrum.\nDental issues develop over a period of time when oral hygiene is not maintained. Dental problems also tend to be very painful impacting the mood and behavior of the autistic individual. On top of everything, going to dentist is also a difficult experience for many autistics. Therefore, preventive care becomes very important. The following information is focused on enabling dental care for young children.\nTools included and how to use\nThis resource includes two types of tools - Social Stories and Visual Lessons.\nSocial Stories\nSocial stories are a widely used tool to support autistic children in understanding and navigating everyday situations. These stories are simple, tailored narratives that break down complex behaviors into clear, manageable steps, helping children learn what to expect and how to respond in various settings. Social stories are also used to introduce and reinforce various day to day behaviours.\nSocial stories can be presented in various formats, including written narratives, pictures, or even videos. They are often read repeatedly to reinforce learning and are most effective when used just before the situation they describe\nVisual Lessons\nLessons and activities built around a visual structure like a graphic story book offer several advantages for helping autistic children learn activities of daily living (ADLs) by leveraging their visual learning strengths and providing structured, engaging ways to practice essential life skills.\nHere are some ways to use visual lessons.\nA note for parents\nAll parents want their childrren to learn and look forward to that happy moment of learning. However, it is important to remember each child is different and has their own ways of being and responding. We can learn to understand there are and will be differences between parents’ expectations and what the child is able to do or demonstrate at any point in time. Please seek help from an expert or the child’s therapist when you are unable to get a desired response from the child or feel stuck at any point.\nAbout the activities\nAll the activities included with the graphic story books are anchored around conversations and discussions, which depend on facilitator’s ability to ask the right questions, modify them as necessary and go with the responses. The objective of the activities is to ensure the learner participates and engages along with the facilitator, and not to test the knowledge or to challenge the learner. The nature of the activities, the visuals and the discussions, is such that by engaging in these activities, the learner is bound to learn. Therefore the key is to get the learner’s cooperation, participation and engagement. Even if the learner does not respond with completely correct answers, it is likely they will learn to implement the steps in their daily lives.\nPreventive dental care includes three important, related areas - food and Hygiene habits, Toothbrushing, Visiting a dentist. By focusing on enabling preventive care, we empower autistic individuals to engage in dental care mindfully, to self manage wherever possible and to make healthy choices.

Cheese, beans, fresh fruits, raw vegetables, leafy greens are good for the teeth.\nFizzy drinks, acidic fruits and sweets are bad for teeth.\n\nCommon Behaviors that impact dental health\nMouthing: Some children tend to keep everything in the mouth. That results in many microbes going into the body.\nChewing: Some children keep everything in their mouth and also chew on them. This is bad for oral hygiene and may also cause injury to teeth and gums.\nBiting: Some children bite everything, like the edge of a table.

You can use the menu as an opportunity to build communication, create a sense of time through the calendar, build it into their weekly schedule, help them get into the habit of checking written instructions or schedules instead of asking the same questions again and again…the possibilities are endless! Remember children love food and it is a great motivator. Refer to our resource on eating for more about managing children’s eating habits.\n\n\n15.3.2 Addressing eating issues\nChildren may have restrictive eating habits, texture sensitivities, chewing issues or may eat too fast or too slow. Based on the severity of the problem, we can choose eating interventions to address these issues. Refer to our resource on eating for more about addressing eating issues.\n\n\n15.3.3 Eating right for healthy teeth - Social Story\nThe social story focuses on basic oral hygiene practices.

    "text": "15.4 Tooth Brushing\nMost of the children with autism face issues with brushing. Tooth brushing is managed ‘some how’. Some times, the strategies that are used to ensure children brush their teeth can result in trauma for the child, engendering negative attitudes towards brushing, and resulting in a lot of distress.\nA variety of issues that are often seen with children on the spectrum are - Unable to open mouth to brush, Unable to allow a brush inside the mouth, eats away the toothpaste, Unable to gargle, Unable to spit, Putting too much or too little pressure while brushing etc.\nWhat can a parent do\nIdentify the issue - The specific issue that a child has to be identified correctly so an intervention can be planned. The person facilitating brushing needs to be clear with what the autistic person finds challenging and plan support accordingly. Not everyone needs everything. If it is a sensory issue, a separate intervention needs to be planned based on the issue - for example, getting specific kinds of toothbrushes like vibration brush, using specific flavoured toothpastes, planning specific massages to prepare the child for brushing.\nAcknowledge the difficulty - It is important to acknowledge the issues that the autistic person has with brushing Avoid feedback such as ‘Drama, ‘Too much’, ‘everyone does brushing, what’s your problem’ etc. Rather, you can say, ‘I understand you are quite upset about brushing. Let us follow schedule and I am here to help you go through it’.\nPreparation - Preparation plays a huge role in developing a favourable attitude to brushing. Having a visual schedule which shows when it is time to brush is one of the key steps. Social stories and general story books about brushing can also help preparation.\n\n15.4.1 Tooth brushing social story\nThe social story focuses on tooth brushing practices.

    "text": "15.5 Visiting a Dentist\nThe final aspect of Preventive care is visiting a dentist periodically.\nVisiting a dentist periodically and learning to interact with the doctor, the people and the environment are important goals to pursue. It will facilitate preventive care which will aid good oral hygiene, education about dental hygiene as well as taking help when there is a need.\nHowever, it is important that the parents or the caretakers understand how challenging it is for the autistic person. The environment at a dentist’s place can be daunting for a person who has never been there. A chair that leans back gradually could throw a person into panic mode. The caretaker as well as the clinic must be sensitive to these experiences and expressions and respond with empathy. The caretakers should ideally carry whatever mode of communication the child uses so that they are able to respond by themselves.\nDo not hesitate to take a step back if the person wants to stop the process mid way. Just leave everything and go home. You can always prepare again and come. Instead, if you push through, it will cause trauma to the autistic person and any future references to a dentist might result in lots of emotional outbursts.\nWhat can a parent do\nPreparation - Preparation helps in building cooperation and managing anxiety around a new place and people. Dentist visit can be marked on a calendar. Social story can help in preparation. A check list can help by keeping things predictable.\n\n15.5.1 Visiting a dentist social story\nThe social story focuses on tooth brushing practices. Read this story repeatedly to reinforce learning.

    "text": "Understanding the Cycle of Dependence\nWhen executive functioning is not well established in an individual, it’s natural for caregivers to step in with lots of help, instructions, and reminders. As a result:\n\nChildren may begin relying heavily on caregivers for “what to do next,” even when they actually know the answer.\nCaregivers can unintentionally set a pattern where their child waits for instructions or approval before acting.\nThis cycle makes it harder for children and young people to build confidence in making their own choices or completing tasks on their own.\n\nExample routines affected:\n\nBrushing teeth\nEating meals\nCompleting homework or learning activities\nEngaging in relaxing activities like drawing or listening to music\n\n\n\nHow This Affects the Whole Family\nOver time, both the child and caregiver can become overwhelmed:\n\nParents/caregivers feel exhausted by constantly giving instructions and worrying about the next step.\nChildren may feel demotivated and lose interest in tasks, sometimes refusing to participate at all.\nBoth may experience emotional outbursts, increased rigidity, and frustration, impacting their connection and the enjoyment of daily life.\n\n\n\nPutting Agency in the Hands of Autistic and ADHD Individuals\nFostering agency means supporting individuals with autism and ADHD to make choices and lead parts of their routines. Key steps include:\n\nCreating a shared workspace: A safe, collaborative space where the autistic or ADHD individual and their caregiver can work together to set goals and decide how to approach tasks.\nMaking independence a goal: Gradually shifting the focus from caregiver-led to self-led routines, even if small steps are needed.\nEncouraging decision-making: Allowing individuals to choose how and when to complete certain activities or tackle challenges.\nUsing visual supports and schedules: Tools like checklists or picture guides can reduce reliance on verbal instructions and boost independence.\n\n\n\nTips for Families and Caregivers\n\nBe patient and flexible—progress toward independence can take time.\nBreak tasks into small, achievable steps, celebrating each success.\nProvide choices whenever possible, so the individual feels ownership over tasks.\nUse consistent routines with clear expectations, but allow for flexibility as skills grow.\nNotice and reduce “prompt dependency”—pause before stepping in, giving the individual a chance to try on their own.\n\n\n\nBuilding Towards Independence\nThe journey toward greater independence is unique for every individual. By sharing responsibility, setting mutual goals, and trusting the capabilities of people with autism or ADHD, families can create a more positive, less stressful experience for everyone.",

A schedule is not something imposed—it’s a shared tool that respects agency, adapts to preferences, and grows with the individual.\n\n\nWhy Use a Schedule?\nSchedules are more than just plans; they’re companions for the day. They:\n\nOrganize your day, giving a sense of what’s coming next.\nCreate calm by reducing surprises.\nReduce overwhelm and anxiety, especially when the world feels unpredictable.\n\nA truly helpful schedule is personal and meaningful.

It’s not an abstract value—it’s a skill you develop, with support.\nWithin an Activity - To become independent in an activity:\n\nKnow the steps.\nHave the skills to do each step.\nUse visual cues or transitions to move between steps.\n\nWithin a Schedule - For independent use of a schedule:\n\nUnderstand how to transition between activities.\nIdentify the next activity and gather the right items.\nSignal for help when needed.\n\nOver a Day - To manage an entire day:\n\nRecognize the day’s activities.\nAdjust for what’s planned each day (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends).\nManage time as well as tasks.\n\nOwning the Whole Process - For full independence:\n\nSet personal goals.\nBreak down big tasks into manageable steps over several days.\nTrack progress, add breaks and self-care, and balance both short-term needs and long-term hopes.",

This is likely to foster sense of failure and lead to procrastination at pathological levels.\n\nThe most common reasons for scheuduling “not working” are:\nPutting an activity in the schedule and not doing it. One needs to ensure to plan such that the child learns to think about schedule as essential to be followed.\nMaking changes to the schedule however we want. Any changes can be made only after informing the child. Even then, it is ideal to reason why it is being done.\nDoing some activities and leaving some activities.\nDoing on some days and not doing on some days.\nBringing in schedule only when there are challenging behaviors.

Our aim is to make reliable and current information available in one place, in an accessible form. The work on this guide started in 2023 and it is up to date so far.\nThe idea of a comprehensive guide for special needs populations in India started out as a shared thought between Azim Premji Foundation and a few partners working in special needs space. Farmhill Learning Community has been involved in the ideation and design, and is currently responsible for creating and maintaining this guide to autism.\nAt farmhill, we have been working with autism for about 15 years. Through farmhill education trust, we have been running sambhavam, an early intervention center, Farm Hill Learning, a neurodiverse, close to nature, learning community as well as subodha, a homeschool support center. This guide has evolved largely out of our experience living with autism, and working with people on the spectrum and their families.\nWe are also glad to have access to the resources and thinking developed over the years at Action for Autism a not for profit organization that pioneered the autism movement in South Asia; ummeed, founded in 2001 by Dr Vibha Krishnamurthy, one of India’s first developmental pediatricians, as a not-for-profit organization with the vision of helping children with and at risk of developmental disabilities reach their full potential and be included in society; and sethu, a charitable trust based in Goa, which helps children get the best out of their lives as they grow and develop. Between them, we have the support of the best organizations working in the autism space in India.\nWe are thankful to Azim Premji Foundation for the support at various levels. This guide would not have seen the light of the day without the involvement and unstinting support of highly dedicated people at APF.\nWhile we have the support of wonderful organizations, and the community at farm hill, the key people actively working to put this guide here are - venu GVGK, Chithra Seshadri and the team comprising Nethra Parthiban, Nandana U and Chandu.

This section would be of interest to those who want to understand the origins of various thoughts and perspectives associated with autism.\nThen we discuss how to identify autism, how common it is, what causes and what does not cause autism. We address the vaccine question (no, there is no evidence), and also present a brief timeline of various causes of autism - most of which have proven to be wrong or of limited understanding.\nIn the next section, we present perspectives of people living with autism, including people on the spectrum, families living with autism, medical professionals, and social workers. We attempt to cover the life cycle of autism by including perspectives from different groups.\nThen we address the diagnosis process starting from the need to diagnosis to the actual process of getting a diagnosis. We also include diagnosis for older people.\nIn the next two sections, we outline the immediate steps a family can take when they receive a diagnosis and proceed to explore various approaches to early intervention.\nWe then strike a cautionary note as we talk about alternative approaches to autism that are consider ineffective and sometimes, dangerous. This is done to ensure we provide all the necessary information.\nThen we proceed to education and schooling, where we examine the goals and approaches to education and schooling in the Indian context.\nThe next section covers employment where we outline how people on the spectrum can train for work. We also provide some resources that can help them find and keep work.\nThe final section deals with being an adult on the spectrum.",
