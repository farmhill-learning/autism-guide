MMS is not recommended for autism. It can have dangerous side effects.
:::</p>
<p>Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) is a controversial substance promoted in alternative health circles. Marketed as a cure for various ailments, MMS is a combination of sodium chlorite and citric acid, creating chlorine dioxide. Advocates claim it can treat conditions like malaria, cancer, and even autism. However, its use is highly controversial and poses serious health risks.</p>
<h3 id="mms-and-autism">MMS and Autism</h3>
<p>MMS has been suggested as a remedy for autism, asserting its ability to alleviate symptoms and enhance well-being in individuals on the autism spectrum. It's essential to note that there is no scientific evidence supporting MMS for autism, and major health organizations strongly advise against its use.</p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) , found in 2006 by Jim Humble, has a controversial history, marked by its promotion as a supposed cure for various illnesses despite serious health risks associated with its use. Here's a brief overview of the history of MMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Origins in Water Purification: MMS is derived from sodium chlorite, a chemical used in some industrial applications, including water purification. It was first promoted by Jim Humble, a former Scientologist, who claimed to have discovered its health benefits during a mining expedition in South America.</li>
<li>Promotion as a Health Supplement: Jim Humble initially marketed MMS as a health supplement with the claim that it could cure numerous diseases, including malaria, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and more. He founded the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing to promote MMS as a sacrament.</li>
<li>Claims for Autism and Other Conditions: Over time, MMS gained attention as a purported treatment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental conditions. Despite lacking scientific evidence, some individuals and groups advocated for its use in the autism community, claiming improvements in symptoms.</li>
<li>Legal Actions and Warnings: Regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health agencies worldwide, raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of MMS. The FDA issued warnings about the potential dangers of consuming MMS, emphasizing its corrosive nature and adverse health effects.</li>
<li>Legal Challenges: Legal actions were taken against individuals and organizations promoting MMS as a cure for various illnesses. Authorities cracked down on the sale and distribution of MMS, emphasizing its lack of approval for medical use and the risks it posed to public health.</li>
<li>Global Controversy: MMS gained international attention and sparked controversy, with health agencies in multiple countries issuing advisories against its use. The substance became a focal point in debates about pseudoscience, unproven treatments, and the potential exploitation of vulnerable populations.</li>
<li>Continued Advocacy Despite Warnings: Despite widespread condemnation and legal actions, there are continued reports of individuals advocating for and using MMS. Online platforms have been used to disseminate information about MMS, leading to ongoing concerns about its accessibility and use.</li>
<li>Ethical Considerations: The promotion of MMS for serious medical conditions, including autism, raises ethical concerns within the medical and scientific communities. Advocates for evidence-based medicine emphasize the importance of protecting individuals from potentially harmful and unproven treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The controversy surrounding MMS underscores the importance of relying on evidence-based medical practices and the need for public awareness regarding potential health risks associated with unproven treatments. In addition, the popularity of MMS at one time as a remedy for autism should make us all weary of the power of zealous beliefs supported with religious fervor and no evidence.</p>
<h3 id="caution">Caution:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lack of Scientific Support: The endorsement of MMS as an autism treatment lacks scientific credibility. Rigorous clinical trials with proper controls and methodologies are absent, rendering any claims about its benefits for autism unproven.</li>
<li>Health Risks and Side Effects: MMS contains chlorine dioxide, an industrial chemical. Ingesting it can lead to severe health risks, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and potentially life-threatening complications. The Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the dangers of MMS consumption.</li>
<li>Ethical Concerns: Using MMS for autism raises ethical concerns, especially when targeting vulnerable populations like children with autism. Advocates for evidence-based medicine and ethical healthcare practices strongly caution against the use of unproven and potentially harmful substances.</li>
<li>Legal Implications: Due to health risks, the sale and distribution of MMS as a medical treatment face legal challenges. Regulatory authorities take actions to prevent its promotion for therapeutic purposes, highlighting the potential harm to public health.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) lacks scientifically proven benefits for treating autism or any health condition. Its use is associated with significant health risks, and regulatory authorities strongly discourage its consumption. Individuals and families seeking interventions for autism are urged to prioritize evidence-based treatments and consult healthcare professionals for the well-being and safety of those with autism spectrum disorder.</p>
